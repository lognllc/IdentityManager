 <title>SpringOne 2GX 2012 Replays: Implementing DDD with Spring and vFabric, Batch Processing and Integration on Cloud Foundry</title>
 <link>http://www.springsource.org/node/22581</link>
 <description>&lt;H1&gt;Implementing Domain-Driven Design with Spring and vFabric&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sponsored by EMC Consulting, this presentation highlights the use of   Domain-Driven Design in a cloud-based, distributed architecture. There   are several working examples of highly scalable DDD models featuring the   NYSE Nanotrader system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;NanoTrader is a VMWare working reference implementation featuring   SpringSource best-practices throughout the application stack. The   functioning high-performance trading application includes Spring MVC   with both web and mobile UI&amp;rsquo;s, Spring Integration, RabbitMQ, GemFire,   Hibernate using SQLFire and/or Postgres. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a   set of software development tools and best practices for crafting a   business strategic initiative in a core domain model. How does   NanoTrader apply DDD? This powerful approach to modeling a trading   system will be showcased from the DDD strategic and tactical modeling   perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Batch Processing and Integration on Cloud Foundry&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Spring Integration is a lightweight integration framework from the   makers of Spring. Integration of data and services between applications   is not easy – and often requires adaptation from one system to another.   Spring Integration also promotes loosely coupled, event-driven   applications. Spring Batch is a batch processing framework – providing a   simple, idiomatic way to crunch large amounts of data across in a   sustainable way. Spring Batch even allows you to distribute processing   across multiple machines in a cluster. Naturally, both of these   frameworks play very nicely on top of Cloud Foundry, which lets you   scale up and out as demand requires. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this talk, Josh Long introduces how to use Spring Batch and Spring   Integration on Cloud Foundry, the open source PaaS from VMware.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Spring Tool Suite and Groovy/Grails Tool Suite 3.3.0.M1 released</title>
 <link>http://www.springsource.org/node/22576</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Spring Community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy to announce the first milestone release 3.3.0.M1 of the Spring Tool Suite (STS) and the Groovy/Grails Tool Suite (GGTS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights from this milestone build include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spring IDE: improved support for JavaConfig-driven Spring projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Groovy-Eclipse: now supports customizable editor templates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Groovy-Eclipse: navigation and hovers in binary (compiled) groovy files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grails-IDE: preliminary support for current builds of Grails 2.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both tool suites ship on top of the latest Eclipse Juno SR2 release. For optimal performance and stability we still recommend the distribution that is&lt;br /&gt;
based on Eclipse 3.8.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second milestone 3.3.0.M2 build is scheduled for early June 2013, followed by the 3.3.0 release in early July 2013 - shortly after the Eclipse Kepler release.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>SpringOne 2GX 2012 Replays: Cloud Foundry Architecture, Effective Design Patterns in NewSQL</title>
 <link>http://www.springsource.org/node/22417</link>
 <description>&lt;H1&gt;Cloud Foundry Architecture&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you have deployed applications on Cloud Foundry, you know how easy it   is to push an app, bind services to it, and scale it. There are more   magical things behind the scenes. Did you know, for example, that   cloudfoundry.com is updated approximately twice a week? Each update   included small changes such as a bug fix or a new feature, but often   large changes such as updating the underlying operating system. Yet, we   can do all this without any downtime for user apps. Come to this talk to   understand what makes this possible. Even if you aren&#039;t going to ever   implement a PaaS on your own (and why should you? we already give you a   good one!), the architectural ideas apply to your distributed apps quite   well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Effective design patterns with NewSQL&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;NewSQL is a term that describes the next generation of highly   distributed, scalable, memory oriented SQL databases. In this session,   we will explore some basic concepts in NewSQL (VMWare SQLFire),   translate a traditional &amp;ldquo;Star&amp;rdquo; schema to a partitioned schema(scale out   design), walk through various SQL usage patterns – simple queries,   complex joins, aggregations, stored procedures and explain how they can   be more effectively realized in SQLFire through replicated tables,   partitioned tables, in-memory or disk resident tables, parallel   procedure execution, distributed transactions, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will also compare and contrast various NewSQL features with traditional SQL.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>SpringOne 2GX 2012 Replays: Virtualizing and Tuning Large Scale Java Applications, From Spring and Java to Spring and Akka</title>
 <link>http://www.springsource.org/node/10268</link>
 <description>&lt;H1&gt;Virtualizing and Tuning Large Scale Java Applications&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This session shares many of the production proven methods of running   Java on vSphere. Covering how to size JVMs, and VMs for large scale   deployments. The session will have a special section on GC tuning and   show how a wide range of JVMs can be tuned using a GC recipe developed   over the past 15 years of actual field experience in tuning JVMs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Three key trends and associated tuning techniques are discussed in   this session. The key trends are: Consolidation, Elasticity and   Flexibility, and Performance&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Consolidation  Many of our customers find that their middleware deployments have   proliferated and are becoming an administrative challenge associated   with higher costs.  We see a trend across customers who look to   virtualization as a way of reducing the number of server instances.  At   the same time, customers are taking the consolidation opportunity to   rationalize the number of middleware components needed to service a   particular load.  Middleware components most commonly run within a Java   Virtual Machine (JVM) with an observed scale of 100 to 1000s of JVM   instances and provide many opportunities for JVM instance consolidation.    Hence, middleware virtualization provides an opportunity to   consolidate twice – once to consolidate server instances, and, secondly,   to consolidate JVM instances.  This trend is far-reaching, because   every IT shop on the planet is considering the cost savings of   consolidation.  One customer in the hospitality sector went through the process of   consolidating their server footprint and at the same time consolidated   many smaller JVMs that were less than 1GB heap.  They consolidated many   of these smaller 1GB JVMs into 2 categories, those that were 4GB, and   others that were 6GB.  They performed the consolidation in such manner   that the net total amount of RAM available to the application was equal   to the original amount of RAM, but with fewer JVM instances.  They did   all of this while improving performance and maintaining good SLAs.  They   also reduced the cost of administration considerably due to the reduced   number of JVM instances they had to manage, and refined environment   that helped easily achieve SLA. &lt;br /&gt;
    Another customer, in the insurance industry, was able to achieve the   same as the above customer, but additionally was able to over-commit CPU   in development and QA environments in order to save on third party   software license costs.  On the other hand, sometimes we come across customers that have a   legitimate business requirement to maintain one JVM for an application,   and/or one JVM per a line of business.  In these cases, you cannot   really consolidate the JVM instances, as that would cause intermixing of   the lifecycle of one application from one line of business with   another.  However, while such customers don&amp;rsquo;t benefit from eliminating   additional JVM instances through JVM consolidation, they do benefit from   more fully utilizing the available compute resource on the server   hardware, that otherwise would have been underutilized in a non   virtualized environment&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Elasticity and Flexibility  It is increasingly common to find applications with seasonal demands.   For example, many of our customers run various marketing campaigns that   drive seasonal traffic towards their application.  With VMware, you can   handle this kind of traffic burst, by automatically provisioning new   virtual machines and middleware components when needed, and then   automatically tear down these VMs when the load subsides.   In addition, the ability to change updating/patching hardware without   causing outage is paramount for middleware that supports the cloud era   scale and uptime.  VMware VMotion gives you the ability to move VMs   around without needing to stop applicators and or the VM.  This   flexibility alone makes virtualization of middleware worthwhile when   managing large-scale middleware deployments. One customer in the   financial space, handling millions of transactions per day, used VMotion   quite often to schedule their hardware upgrades without any time   downtime.  What otherwise would be a costly scheduled downtime to their   business.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Performance  Customers often report improved middleware platform performance when   virtualizing. Performance improvements are partly due to the updated   hardware that customers will typically refresh during a virtualization   project. There is also some performance improvement due to the robust   VMware hypervisor.  A recent customer that reported a great level of   performance provided the following testimony&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;With our OrderExpress project we upgraded our Middleware Services,   Commerce, Portal, WCM, Service Layer, DB2 Database; migrated from AIX to   Linux; virtualized on VMware; moved the application into a three-tier   DMZ; increased our transactions by over 150 percent; and added   significant new capabilities that greatly improved the customer   experience. Changing such a wide range of technology components at once   was a huge challenge. However using VMware vSphere and additional   architectural changes we were successful in improving performance by   over 300 percent; lowered costs in the millions; improved security,   availability, and scalability; and how we plan to continue evolving this   application to maintain greater than 30 percent yearly growth.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;– Jeff Battisti, Senior Enterprise Architect at Cardinal Health&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this session, I will show some actual JVM and VM sizes for   middleware components both small and large JVMs. Will also detail out GC   tuning recipe that I have developed over the years,that has been shown   to handle JVM heap sizes form 4GB to 88GB+, and higher. Of course the   introduction of in-memory databases has driven the trend to have these   larger JVMs and hence why we will discuss what is the best way to tune   the JVM, VM, and the hardware platform they are deployed on. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I see the sizing question as the most commonly asked question with   our customer base,and as a result I plan to focus on it during the   session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;From Spring + Java to Spring + Akka - A Journey of Discovery&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Actor based concurrency model is a paradigm shift. What is paradigm shift?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A change in the basic assumptions, or paradigms, within the ruling   theory of science. A paradigm shift makes simple ideas hard to grok.   Even though Actor model is a simple and revolutionary idea it becomes   hard for programmers to see practical benefits and usage. Similarly, the   Scala programming language brings a lot to the table in simplifying   actor-based design, but comes with a new style of coding.  One possible   solution to this problem is to evaluate the new paradigm in terms of old   paradigm. In this presentation we will take a working Spring based web   application and gradually implement it using actors and Scala. We will   be skeptical and suspicious of new ideas but at the same time we will be   open minded. We will learn about actor based concurrency model using   the knowledge of spring.  At the same time, we&#039;ll learn best practices   behind Actors, Scala and combining these with the Spring Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Spring Batch 2.2.0 RC1 is now available</title>
 <link>http://www.springsource.org/node/9666</link>
 <description>We are pleased to announce that Spring Batch 2.2.0.RC1 is now available via the SpringSource Milestone repository.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.springsource.org/spring-batch&quot;&gt;Spring Batch Home&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-batch&quot;&gt;Source on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/&quot;&gt;Reference Documentation&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Support for Spring Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.springsource.org/spring-data&quot;&gt;Spring Data&lt;/a&gt; is a collection of projects intended to make it easier to develop Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational databases. Based on a model of exposing &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.springsource.org/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/Repository.html&quot;&gt;Repository&lt;/a&gt; objects, Spring Data allows applications to access data in a simple and consistent way across many new platforms. Spring Batch 2.2.0.RC1 now provides &lt;code&gt;ItemReader&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ItemWriter&lt;/code&gt; implementations for a number of the data stores supported by Spring Data including MongoDB, Neo4j, and Gemfire (write only).  In addition, Spring Batch 2.2.0.RC1 now has a &lt;code&gt;RepositoryItemReader&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RepositoryItemWriter&lt;/code&gt; that will read and write items from custom Spring Data &lt;code&gt;Repository&lt;/code&gt; implementations.
&lt;h2&gt;Java Configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
With this release, Spring Batch 2.2.0.RC1 now supports Java based job definitions. Building a job definition with java configuration is now available via the new &lt;code&gt;@EnableBatchProcessing&lt;/code&gt; annotation and a collection of builders that allow you to construct jobs, steps, flows, splits, etc. By using the &lt;code&gt;@EnableBatchProcessing&lt;/code&gt; annotation the following features are enabled:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creation of StepScope - Allowing the configuration of beans via &lt;code&gt;@Scope(&quot;step&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Autowired&lt;/code&gt; - A &lt;code&gt;JobRepository&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;JobLauncher&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;JobRegistry&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PlatformTransactionManager&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;JobBuilderFactory&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;StepBuilderFactory&lt;/code&gt; are all available to be autowired into your context.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Non-identifying Job Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;
Spring Batch 2.2.0.RC1 now supports the use of job parameters that do not contribute to the generation of a JobInstance&#039;s identity. As part of this update, the &lt;code&gt;JobParameters&lt;/code&gt; is no longer associated with a &lt;code&gt;JobInstance&lt;/code&gt; and is now associated with a &lt;code&gt;JobExecution&lt;/code&gt;. To support this change, the job repository schema has updated and a migration script has been provided. You can read the details about the migration script in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/getting-started.html&quot;&gt;Getting Started Guide&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;h2&gt;Other Improvements and Bug Fixes&lt;/h2&gt;
With the release of Spring Batch 2.2.0.RC1, a host of other improvements and bug fixes have been added. The complete list of updates for this release can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/migration/index.html&quot;&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt; for this revision.

 <title>SpringOne 2GX 2012 Replays: Getting Started with Spring Security 3.1, What&#039;s new with Tooling for Spring, Grails and the Cloud</title>
 <link>http://www.springsource.org/node/4309</link>
 <description>&lt;H1&gt;Getting Started with Spring Security 3.1&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Spring Security is a framework that focuses on providing both   authentication and authorization to Java applications. Like all Spring   projects, the real power of Spring Security is found in how easily it   can be extended to meet custom requirements. In this presentation Rob   will incrementally apply Spring Security to an existing application to   demonstrate how it can meet your authentication and authorization needs.   It will also answer many of the common &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; questions that are   found on the forums. This will ensure that you can not only secure your   application quickly, but ensure you understand Spring Security well   enough to extend it to meet your custom requirements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What&#039;s new with tooling for Spring, Grails and the Cloud&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this talk we will give an overview of the recently open-sourced   and newly organized tooling landscape for Spring, Groovy/Grails and   Cloud Foundry (we&amp;rsquo;ll touch on Gradle too). We will introduce the new   open-sourced tooling projects and how they fit together to form our new   distributions: the Spring Tool Suite and the Groovy/Grails Tool Suite.   In addition to that we will demo the latest feature additions to the   tools that enable you to be even more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The first part of this talk will focus on Spring whilst the second   part focuses on Groovy/Grails.  Attend one (or both!) parts of the   session.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Webinar Replay: Extending Spring Integration for Splunk</title>
 <link>http://www.springsource.org/node/4308</link>
 <description>  &lt;p&gt;Join David Turanski (SpringSource) and Damien Dallimore (Splunk) as they discuss and demonstrate Splunk and Spring Integration. Spring Integration provides a number of adapters out of the box to support various transports, such as JMS, File, HTTP, Web Services, and Mail. They will introduce the Splunk channel adapter, a new entry to the out of the box adapters available for Spring Integration, which allows data to flow through Spring Integration to interact with data being ingested or queried by Splunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who may be unfamiliar, Splunk collects, indexes and harnesses machine-generated big data so you can monitor, search, analyze, visualize and act on large streams of real-time and historical machine data.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/EFqEqD8djfc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
