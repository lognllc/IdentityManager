<p><span>&ldquo;</span>In Groovy and Grails it is easy to build a prototype very fast and show it to the client. This is the perfect tool for prototyping.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>&ldquo;</span>A new developer can ramp up on Groovy and Grails in a couple weeks. It would take several months, maybe even a year, to get up to speed on our old in-house framework.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>&ldquo;</span>The great value of Groovy and Grails is less code, which means less maintenance, and that saves time. Because of the conventions, any developer that knows Grails can look at the code and immediately understand what is going on. This makes maintenance much easier.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span>&ldquo;</span>We like the integration between Spring and Hibernate&hellip;We not only gain the advantages of Spring dependency injection, but we also get the benefits of using Hibernate to take care of mapping data to the database.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span>&ldquo;</span>Using Spring, our development time, debugging and testing is reduced by 30%. This is a critical advantage because of our tight deadlines for prototype delivery.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>&ldquo;</span>With Spring, we write better code. Better written code means it is easier to understand an issue and fix it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>&ldquo;</span>One of the advantages of SpringSource dm Server, thanks to OSGi, is the ability to deploy different versions of the same library and share them between applications&hellip;this results in a lower footprint.&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>
