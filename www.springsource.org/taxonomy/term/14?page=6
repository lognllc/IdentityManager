<P> 
    Welcome back to another installment of <EM>This Week in Spring</EM>. 
	
 	 Seems like we were just staring down the holiday season a minute ago, doesn't it? Here we are a month on into the new year, already. Time sure does fly. 

 We've got lots of exciting new content, and a <EM>lot</EM> of it is either videos or full texts that you can read, be sure to skim through this roundup and then find yourself a nice cozy chair to absorb the rest of it and enjoy!

	<LI>  <a href = "http://www.springsource.org/node/3382">Spring.NET Social 1.0.0 Has Been Released!</A> Hot on the heels of <a href ="http://www.springsource.org/spring-social/news/1.0.0-released">Spring Social 1.0 (for Java)</a>'s release late last year, <a href = "http://www.springframework.net">Spring.NET</a> Social   1.0.0 has been released with the foundation API as well as API implementations for Dropbox,  LinkedIn and Twitter.   </LI>

	<LI>Speaking of Spring Social, <A href = "http://www.springone2gx.com/conference/speaker/craig_walls">Craig Walls</a>' SpringOne2GX talk,  <a href ="http://www.springsource.org/node/3380">The Rise of OAuth</A>,
		 is now available on <A href = "http://www.infoq.com">InfoQ.com</a>. The talk introduces the nuanced world of OAuth, and then introduces how Spring Social and Spring Security can make interoperating with, and providing, OAuth-based services easier.    </LI> 

		
	<LI> <a href = "http://www.springone2gx.com/conference/chicago/2011/10/speakers/michael_hunger">Michael Hunger</a>, <a href = "http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/neo4j">Spring Data Neo4J</A> contributor and Neo4J ninja, has put together a <EM>very</EM> good guide on the <a href = "http://www.springsource.org/spring-data">Spring Data</A> projects called 
 <EM>Good Relationships</EM>. <a href = "http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/good-relationships-spring-data"><EM>Good Relationships</EM> is available as a free download from our   friends at InfoQ</a>. Michael,  besides being a prolific coder (I'm still not convinced the man sleeps...), is a very good writer. He contributed the amazing content (not to mention the addon itself!) regarding the Spring Roo Neo4J addon to the   book that co-author Steve Mayzak and I 	wrote about Spring Roo for O'Reilly  last year (which is <EM>also</EM> <a href="http://spring-roo-repository.springsource.org/Getting_Started_with_Roo.pdf">available as a free download!</a>. Thanks, O'Reilly, and Michael!). 

 I recommend this book - Michael's a NoSQL ninja,  and an inspirational voice in the community. 

Incidentally, this is a fine time to revisit  Michael's SpringOne2GX 2011 talk, <a href = "http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Introduction-to-Spring-Data-Neo4j">Introduction to Spring Data Neo4j</A>, <EM>also</EM> on InfoQ!

This talk introduces mobile application development techniques using HTML5. </LI>


		 <LI> Frequent blogger Alex Soto has a blog on <a href = "http://www.thymeleaf.org">Thymeleaf</a>, the powerful templating 

			 library that works marvelously with Spring MVC. Alex introduces <a href= "	http://www.lordofthejars.com/2012/01/once-upon-time-and-long-ago-i-heard.html">Thymeleaf, and a simple Spring MVC and HTML5 Maven archetype</a>, which you can use to bootstrap your own Spring MVC project.
		 </LI>	


	<LI> In large teams with many modules, it is helpful to decouple implementations of services from their interface contracts. Dependency injection, and Spring in particular, make this trivial.   Tobias Flohre  outlines a structure for building loosely coupled business components  with a minimal of fuss. <a href = "http://blog.codecentric.de/en/2012/01/a-business-component-architecture-with-spring-3-03-1-part-1-structure">Tobias employs Spring's Java configuration support to achieve the loose coupling of contracts and implementations</A>  - extricating the knowledge about which implementation is being used to the configuration. </LI>

	 In his blog,	Brian Du Preez talks about his latest project and how he got it to work with <a href = "http://www.briandupreez.net/2012/01/spring-3-string-web-services-2-ldap.html">	Spring 3.0, Spring Web Services 2.0 and Spring   Security LDAP</a>.  Nice job, Brian! Thanks for sharing the details on this - it'll benefit numerous others who are no doubt doing the same sort of thing in their own environments.

	<LI> This blog demonstrates <A href ="http://www.jroller.com/ejboy/entry/using_h2_connection_pool_in">how to configure a connection pool in Spring that connects to the in-memory database, H2.</a>   </LI>
	<LI> Geraint Jones has a nice blog introducing <a href = "http://city81.blogspot.com/2012/01/spring-mvc-and-restful-web-services.html">how to setup RESTful services using Spring MVC</A>.  </LI>
	<LI> Jeff Zapotoczny details his <a href = "http://www.summa-tech.com/blog/2012/01/23/spring-batch-imperfect-yet-worthwhile/">first steps with Spring Batch and Spring Batch Admin</a>. Jeff felt that <a href = "http://www.springsource.org/spring-batch">Spring Batch</A> was a bit heavy-handed at first (it's easy to get that impression on first blush - it has <EM>so</EM> many features!)  but on consulting with his team members he realized that Spring Batch, and <a href ="http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch-admin/getting-started.html">Spring Batch Admin</A>, were just right.  
		I'll be looking for more of Jeff's journey, and in the meantime, if you've got a batch problem to solve, why don't you take your first steps with Spring Batch?

<P>
	  Welcome to another installment of <EM>This Week in Spring </EM>.
	
	We are already almost done with January (which, honestly, shocks me. Where <EM>does</EM> the time go?)
	</P> 
	<OL> 
		<LI> Did you guys see last week's webinar introducing Spring 3.1 with Spring project lead, and VMWare/SpringSource Principal Engineer, Juergen Hoeller?  
           Last week's webinar was <EM>very</EM> well-attended, and represents the best turnout yet, by far, for all of the SpringSource webinars. So, thanks to all those who came, and, to the handful of people on earth that couldn't make it, don't worry! You can watch 
<a href = "http://www.springsource.org/node/3378">the Spring 3.1 webinar's recording</a> on <a href = "http://www.youtube.com/springsourcedev">the SpringSource YouTube page</A>.
				
		
			  </LI>
			
			<LI>  
 The next item is a video is one of my favorites. It's the second part of  a  two part talk that  Ramnivas Laddad, Scott Andrews and Jennifer Hickey - all SpringSource heavyweights now also working on <a href = "http://www.cloudfoundry.org">Cloud Foundry</a> - gave at 
  <a href = "http://www.springone2gx.com/conference/chicago/2011/10/home">SpringOne 2GX 2011</a> on using   <a href = "http://www.springsource.org/node/3376">Cloud Foundry with Spring</a>.
 So, where is the first part? I'm not so sure. I hope InfoQ also got that video, as well, but either way this is a very useful 
	       video. And, they're a great testament to the value of the content created for SpringOne  2GX.
 
			  </LI>
		 <LI> <A href = "http://www.springsource.org/node/3377">The SpringSource Tool Suite, 2.9.0.M2, has been released</a>.  
			 This release of the <a href ="http://www.springsource.com/developer/sts">SpringSource Tool Suite</a> has many new features, including  
			 an  update to TcServer 2.6.3,  an update to Spring Roo 1.2.0 (and updated support for the new Spring Roo service arrangements  - repositories, services, etc.), an update to Grails 2.0.0 and   Groovy 1.8, and initial support for editing Gradle files. 
			</LI>
		
		 <LI>  Google App Engine Product Manager Chris Ramsdale gave a great talk about <a href ="http://www.springsource.org/node/3373">using Spring on Google App Engine</a> for SpringOne2GX 2011. This a good talk, and also a strong testament to Spring's unique portability story.  </LI>
		
		
		<LI>A blogger, whose name I was not able to uncover, wrote up a <em>fantastic</EM> post on
			<a href = "http://www.insaneprogramming.be/?p=358">his first steps with Spring Integration 2.1</a>. In the blog's example, he talks a little about <CODE>channels</CODE>, the Spring Integration FTP and XML support, and then.. the blog's done! Because, Spring Integration's just that simple.  This is definitely worth a read.  I love that he came to Spring Integration in basically the same fashion as I - and numerous others - have: we'd used big, fat, horrid ESBs and wanted a leaner, cleaner, open-source (and, tangentially, Spring-friendly) alternative. Nice job, and welcome to the community.

				The   <a href = "http://www.springsource.org/spring-social">Spring Social</a> and <a href ="https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-twitter">Spring Social Twitter</a> 1.0.2 releases primarily <a href = "http://www.springsource.org/spring-social/news/1.0.2-released">fix bugs found since 1.0.1 and adds a few small enhancements</a>.
				
				The  <a href = "https://github.com/springsource/spring-social-linkedin">Spring Social LinkedIn</a> release includes API binding for LinkedIn's Group API, which completes the LinkedIn API binding. 
				The Spring Social LinkedIn binding's very mature, at this point, and the steady march towards 1.0 will start with a first RC, soon. 
 
				</li>	<LI> Last April, Spring project lead and SpringSource Principal Engineer Juergen Hoeller gave an interview to JSF Central's Kito D. Mann on   <a href = "http://www.jsfcentral.com/articles/hoeller-01-12.html">Spring 3.1, JSF, and more</a>. I'm not too sure why this podcast took so long to materialize, but it's here, and still fairly timely, almost a year later.  Enjoy. 

					</LI>		<LI> Our pals over at Chariot Solutions have posted a <EM>very</EM> comprehensive <a href = "http://blog.chariotsolutions.com/2012/01/spring-31-cool-new-features.html">roundup of the new features in Spring 3.1</a>.  As usual, they knock it out of the park. There's a reason these guys are great trainers...   </LI> 
				
				<LI>
					Willie Wheeler followed up on the  <a href = "http://springinpractice.com/2012/01/17/spring-social-github-revisiting-github-integration/">nature of the contributions he'd made to Spring Social GitHub</a>, which we talked about here in this very column, last week. 
					
			</LI>
			<LI> Tobias Trelle is back with the second installment of his exploration of Spring Data. This week, <a href = "http://blog.codecentric.de/en/2012/01/spring-data-jpa/">he's introducing Spring Data JPA</a>.   Definitely worth a read (and bookmark - he promises even more great stuff to come). Check it out! </LI>

		
		 <LI> Lots of people are taking the first, intrepid steps into the brave new world of Scala development and want to establish 
			good, reusable practices for working with Spring and Spring MVC with Scala. The <EM>Orange Apple</EM> blog  offers a 
			<a href = "http://www.orangeapple.org/post/15811593429/scala-based-spring-hibernate-wireframe-to-get-you?98ea0958">Scala-based Spring and Hibernate <EM>wireframe</EM> application to get you started</a>. This, the blogger (<EM><CODE>ykameshrao</CODE></EM>, on GitHub) volunteers, is <a href = "https://github.com/ykameshrao/scala-spring-hibernate-springmvc-maven-framework">his first open source</a> project, and   I think it's a wonderful one. <EM>Really</EM> nice work! Keep it up.
			
			   </LI>
				<LI>  
					The Monitis blog has some good tips on <a href = "http://blog.monitis.com/index.php/2012/01/24/using-tomcat-with-a-database-performance-optimization-tips/">optimizing database performance with Tomcat</a>. 
 </Li>
				<LI> Over on <A href = "http://www.TomcatExpert.com">TomcatExpert.com</a>,  Stacey Schneider announced the <a href ="http://www.tomcatexpert.com/blog/2012/01/24/apache-tomcat-7025-released">Apache Tomcat 7.0.25 release</a>, which includes several enhancements, including  
					 
					an alignment of the  Servlet 3.0 implementation with the changes defined in the first maintenance release (also known as Rev. A.), 
				added support for connectors to automatically select a free port to bind to, and an update  to Commons Pool 1.5.7, Commons Daemon 1.0.8 and Eclipse JDT compiler 3.7.1.   </LI>
				 <LI> <A href  = "http://www.tomcatexpert.com">TomcatExpert.com</A> also has a great post that explains how to use the  new, highly concurrent connection pool that ships with Tomcat 7 (<CODE>org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.DataSourceFactory</CODE>) as a replacement for the Commons DBCP pool. 
					
					This is one handy, dandy pool! You only need to scroll down the page to see all the new, enterprise grade features supported. I'm personally excited to try it!

		 <LI>Pssst. What are you guys doing this Thursday, the 19th?  
			If you haven't already, may I suggest you register for    
			the <a href= "http://www.springsource.org/node/3364">Spring 3.1 webinar with Juergen Hoeller and Chris Beams</a>? 
			
			
			
			If you're in Europe,  there's going to be a  webinar  at <a href = "https://vmwareevents.webex.com/vmwareevents/onstage/g.php?t=a&d=663415641">3PM GMT, or 4PM CEST</a>, and if you're in North America, there's going to be a webinar at <a href = "https://vmwareevents.webex.com/vmwareevents/onstage/g.php?t=a&d=668718779">1PM EST or 10AM PST</a>. 
			 Don't be left out, this event's already seen the highest registration of any webinar thus far, so register now, and as usual, I hope to see you there.

		<LI> Another session from SpringOne2GX, on <a href = "http://www.springsource.org/node/3365">Writing Applications for Cloud Foundry using Spring and MongoDB</a>, has been posted.  The Spring material is presented by data expert Thomas Risberg and the Mongo material is presented by Jared Rosoff from 10gen.  </LI>
	<LI>  Willie Wheeler, author of Manning's <EM>Spring in Practice</EM>, has put together a great blog post called <a href ="http://springinpractice.com/2012/01/14/calling-the-github-api-using-springs-resttemplate/">Calling the GitHub API using Spring's <CODE>RestTemplate</CODE>.</a>    
		
		 Craig Walls, author of Manning's own <EM>Spring in Action</EM> and lead of the <a href ="https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-github">Spring Social Github project</a> read this blog post and reached out to Willie. They started collaborating. A few <a href ="https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-github/pull/2">pull requests</a> later and that integrated, cleaned up idea and code is now in Spring Social Github <CODE>master</CODE>, ready to be incorporated in the next release. That's three days from blog to <CODE>master</CODE>! This is a great example of how powerful open source is. Don't hesitate <a href= "http://blog.springsource.org/2010/12/21/social-coding-in-spring-projects/">to get involved</a>, too!

		 Willie Wheeler's been busy, of late!  Some content from his  upcoming book is available on the internet.  In particular,  <a href= "http://www.java-tv.com/2012/01/16/creating-your-first-spring-web-mvc-application/">Creating Your First Spring MVC applications</A> is really good, and worth a read.  He also has another post, <A href = "http://springinpractice.com/2012/01/07/making-formselect-work-nicely-using-spring-3-formatters/">
		 Making <CODE>&lt;form:select/&gt;</CODE> work nicely using Spring 3 Formatters</a>, that is <EM>definitely</EM> worth a read! It answers a very common question and shows the latest and greatest in best practices. Nice job, Willie!

	<li> Possibly inspired by the <a href = "http://blog.springsource.org/2011/04/12/roo-cloud-foundry-productivity-in-the-cloud/">Cloud Foundry add-on for Spring Roo</a>, Shekhar Gulati at Xebia has cooked up another PaaS add-on, <a href= "http://xebee.xebia.in/2012/01/09/running-spring-java-mongodb-apps-on-openshift-express-using-spring-roo-openshift-express-addon/">this time for Openshift</a>. 
		
		
		This is a great example of Spring Roo's powerful addon mechanism and the ecosystem thats grown up around it.   If Spring Roo doesn't have something for you, <a href = "http://code.google.com/p/spring-roo-openshift-express-addon/">it's easy enough to extend it</a>! Readers of this blog will recall that Shekhar wrote the great blogs introducing Spring Roo on his <a href = "http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/opensource/libraryview.jsp?search_by=introducing+spring+roo,">IBM Developer Works series</a>, which, if you didn't read it then, you should read now.

		<LI>  Always eager to help ring in the new year properly, Mark Fisher announced the <a href  = "http://blog.springsource.org/2012/01/09/spring-integration-2-1-is-now-ga/">Spring Integration 2.1 GA</a> yesterday.   
			 The new release has <EM>everything</EM>, and then some! It features new or revised support for a broad spectrum of technologies including AMQP, JDBC, GemFire, MongoDB, Redis, and much, much more.

		 <LI> Open source Java and, in particular, Tomcat, rule the day. Now, more than ever, people are rejecting heavy, monolithic application servers in favor of lightweight, singly focused applications that can be partitioned horizontally on both the front end and the backend. More often than not, they are choosing Tomcat to meet this requirement.

		<LI> Community member and DevNexus organizer Gunnar Hillert has put together an awesome blog on a powerful, if underrated new feature in Spring 3.1: <a href = "http://hillert.blogspot.com/2011/12/method-validation-with-hibernate.html">support for validating business service methods using JSR 303 and Spring</a>. This support is manifest in the Spring MVC REST support for validating marshalled entities that are part of the request. But, as Gunnar explains, the

		In the case of the <CODE>javax.sql.DataSource</CODE>, you can simply  reference it when configuring a <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.1.x/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/spring-framework-reference.html#jmx"><CODE>org.springframework.jmx.export.MBeanExporter</CODE></a>.   Obtaining the <EM>native</EM> <CODE>EntityManagerFactory</CODE> isn't difficult, either and shouldn't require a subclass, as the <CODE>AbstractEntityManagerFactoryBean</CODE> base class exposes a public <CODE>nativeEntityManagerFactory</CODE> field which might have worked instead. Anyway,  the concepts are interesting, and - in the end - the blog <EM>does</EM> demonstrate  how to expose JMX information from objects that don't already expose them, so that's very cool. Nice job!

	<LI> JavaCodeGeeks has an interesting post on using Spring to <a href = "http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2011/12/spring-mvc-and-rest-at-google-app.html">build RESTful services on Google App Engine</a>.  There's very little specific to Spring here (as that just works - after all, Spring's unparalleled in its ability to work on any cloud). Instead, this post covers the minutae of configuring Google App Engine and of configuring Maven, and so on. A worthy read if you're looking for the details.

			Santa's elves could learn a thing or two from the SpringSource engineers!  <a href= "http://blog.springsource.org/2011/12/17/spring-roo-1-2-0-release-available/">Alan Stewart  announced Spring Roo 1.2.0 GA</a>  on <EM>Saturday</EM>. 
			   This version of Roo has caught the attention of a <EM>lot</EM> of people. While there are many new features, some of my favorites are   the multi-module Maven project support (which lets you, for example, build your model classes in a separate project from your web application),
 support	JSF / PrimeFaces scaffolding (as opposed to just GWT, Spring MVC, Vaadin, and Flex),
	support for services / repositories (using Spring Data JPA and Spring Data MongoDB; this is in addition to the Active record style data-access objects already available),
 and 
	(more) flexible GWT support.

			<LI>  When Spring 3.1 was released last week, I imagine <a href= "http://www.springsource.org/spring-gemfire">Spring Data Gemfire</a> and <a href = "http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/redis">Spring Data Redis</a> lead Costin Leau hit a big red button that he had prepared for just this occasion. 
			First, Costin released <a href ="http://www.springsource.org/node/3336">Spring Data Gemfire 1.1.0</a> , 
				which has <EM>numerous</EM> features!  
				 Besides supporting Spring 3.1 (including a 3.1-compatible implementation of the Spring Cache API), Spring Data Gemfire 1.1.0  supports PDX (the binary object serialization type supported by Gemfire) attributes on the <CODE>&lt;cache/&gt;</code>, <CODE>&lt;client-cache/&gt;</CODE> namespace, it provides dedicated support for indices, better support for <CODE>Region</CODE> creation, <CODE>CacheServer</CODE> support, queries with variable parameters, and a <code>MessageListenerContainer</CODE> like abstraction that works with Gemfire's continuous queries (CQs). The CQ support is the basis of the GemFire inbound adapter support available in Spring Integration 2.1, due any minute now.. 
				
				   </LI>
			<LI> Then, Costin released <a href ="http://www.springsource.org/node/3337">Spring Data Redis 1.0.0</a>, a major milestone in of itself!   
				
					This release, besides being compatible with Spring 3.1, supports atomic counters, a <CODE>RedisTemplate</CODE>, data access exception translation (consistent with the support you expect from all of Spring's data access technologies), a <CODE>MessageListenerContainer</CODE> abstraction that builds on Redis' pub-sub support, and much more!
				</LI>
	 	
			<LI> But Costin wasn't the only one sitting on a Spring 3.1 compatible release. <a href ="http://www.springsource.org/spring-social">Spring Social</a>   lead Craig Walls    <a href= "http://www.springsource.org/spring-social/news/1.0.1-released">announced Spring Social 1.0.1</a>, which, besides being Spring 3.1- and Spring Security 3.1-compatible, also provides numerous bug fixes and updates.  </LI>

				Mihai Dinca-Panaitescu has written up a quick, but concise, blog on <a href= "http://java.dzone.com/articles/spring-3-and-application">how to configure beans using external values (property files, or external systems, all together) using Spring 3.0</a>.  
				
 Of course, Spring 3.1 now also supports the <CODE>Environment</CODE> abstraction, which makes retrieving properties from Java configuration a snap. So, as usual, Spring gives you choices, and in this particular case  you have three different ways to cross the finish line. </LI>
			<LI> 
 In the same vein, Aurelien Broszniowski has blogged on <a href= "http://java.dzone.com/articles/use-spring-create-system">how to use Maven's property filtering to <EM>set</EM> a system property at runtime</a>. 

Maven, for those of you who don't know, will automatically replace properties (of the same form as Spring's property support: <CODE>${foo}</CODE>, for example) if you enable resource filtering. So, the <EM>build</EM> can be differentiated 
by which Maven profile is active. The result is that you get one build for one profile, and another for another profile.  

Another way to handle this sort of thing might be to use Spring 3.1's <code><a href = "http://blog.springsource.org/2011/02/14/spring-3-1-m1-introducing-profile/">@Profile</a></code> support.

All of these are good reasons, and I  wholly recommend them. One thing that should be pointed out, and Chris Beams, Spring framework committer, <a href = "http://www.baeldung.com/2011/12/02/the-persistence-layer-with-spring-3-1-and-hibernate/#comment-377082446">does point out</a>, is that while this blog's example uses Hibernate 3, Spring 3.1 also supports Hibernate 4.

The book describes, among other things, how to use REST. That is, it's one thing to think of REST as being an HTTP-centric RPC mechanism, but to really grok it is something else entirely. On this subject, I can recommend no finer reference than Jim's book and  of course <a href = "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">Roy Fielding's original work</a>. In Jim's book, however, he establishes an example of an automated coffee shop, <EM>RestBucks</EM>, which exposes an API. (This example itself is a twist on the example established in the simialarly seminal <EM>Patterns of Enterprise Architecture</EM>)  
				It's a wonderful book, a fantastic example, and, more to the point,  it makes perfect fodder for blogger "Furious Bob" to <a href= "http://www.dzone.com/links/r/spring_31_rest_no_xml_caching_support_etag_and_ha.html">demonstrate a cleanly architected   application using Spring 3.1's enhanced REST support</a>.

In the blog, Willie describes <a href ="http://www.dzone.com/links/r/configuring_jackson_to_use_jaxb2_annotations_with.html">how to enable Jackson (a JSON serialization library) to use JAXB2 (an XML serialization standard with several implementations) annotations with the Spring OXM library</a>. Spring, of course, provides the Spring object-to-XML (or, OXM) module as part of its core. The inspiration is that, if you want to generate RESTful views of your entities, you need to use  something like JAXB for the XML view and Jackson for the JSON view. If you want to configure the mapping from Java object to another serialization, you usually annotate the Java object with annotations, which yeilds domain entities with redundant mapping annotations (one for JSON, one for XML!). Well, now you can use the same JAXB2 annotations for both purposes. Now, if we could just reduce the redundancies between JAXB and JPA...

Welcome back to another installment of <EM>This Week in Spring</EM>. For those of us in the US, the Thanksgiving holiday is upon us.
	  
Generally, the idea behind Thanksgiving (which has analogs in many other countries, as well) is to have a day to reflect on the things we are thankful for. 

In that spirit, let me offer one of the things that I am thankful for: thank you, dear readers, for being part of the most awesome
community out there.  		
Between all the cool stuff you guys are doing and all the cool stuff happening at SpringSource, 
it is an absolute pleasure to put together this roundup every week.  We hope you have a wonderful week and we look forward to seeing you next week.
