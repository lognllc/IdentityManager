<P> Another fantastic week in the Spring community. Can you guys believe it's already the 8th of November? Where <EM>does</EM> the time go? 
	
	If you blink, we'll be in 2012 already! 
	No time to waste - the year might change out from underneath us! - let's dive right into this week's roundup!

<LI>  Ramnivas Laddad, senior engineer on the Cloud Foundry project and a hero world wide to those who - like me - enjoy the use of AspectJ in their  Spring applications, has put together a fantastic post shining a light on the specific <a href="http://blog.springsource.org/2011/11/04/using-cloud-foundry-services-with-spring-part-2-auto-reconfiguration/">support for services (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and RabbitMQ) in Cloud Foundry</a>.  This is the second post in a series. Read the first one to learn about <a href="http://blog.springsource.org/2011/10/13/using-cloud-foundry-services-with-spring-part-1-the-basics/">the basics of services on Cloud Foundry</a>. <EM>Awesome</EM> posts with great details. 	</li>

<LI> This next post is among the posts that made me smile this week. Roy Clarkson and I did a talk at <A href="http://www.springone2gx.com">SpringOne 2GX</A> a few weeks ago on native Android development practices with Spring. We sat down the night before our talk and ran through our deck and demonstrations, only to realize that - in the interim weeks since everything was originally prepared, the  delicate spider's web of configuration required  to get Eclipse (<A href= "http://www.springsource.com/developer/sts">SpringSource Tool Suite</A>), Maven, and Android all speaking to each other and working correctly had been... <em>disturbed</EM>. We did the talk with a non-Maven build with great success, but it still irked us that we had to switch to a regular Eclipse build so that the talk could proceed.  Roy, always intrepid and fearless, has since figured out the right permutations of configurations required to get this all working again and - generous guy that he is - <a href= "http://blog.springsource.org/2011/11/07/updated-maven-support-for-android-projects/">he has documented everything in this blog</A>. Check it out! (I know I did!)</LI> 
	<LI> Tomcat Expert has another practical column on <A href = "http://www.tomcatexpert.com/blog/2011/11/02/best-practices-securing-apache-tomcat-7">administering and developing with Apache Tomcat 7</a>. The post explains how to take the default security configuration Apache Tomcat 7 to the next level with a bit of background on the configuration options available. 
		
	</LI> 



	<LI> Roger Hughes <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/using-jsr-250s-postconstruct">introduces how to use JSR 250's <CODE>@PostConstruct</CODE> and <CODE>@PreDestroy</CODE> annotations</A> to replace the use of the corresponding Spring  callback interfaces, <CODE>InitializingBean</CODE> and <CODE>DisposableBean</CODE>.   </LI> 

	<LI>Michal Huniewicz explains <a href= "http://blog.m1key.me/2011/10/wizard-form-with-spring-mvc.html">how to create a wizard form with Spring MVC</a>.  
		
	 His solution's certainly one way to solve the problem (and worth a look), but as Spring MVC engineer Rossen  Stoyanchev  notes in the comments, developers should alternatively consider Spring Web Flow for these types of use cases, as well.
		
</LI>

	<LI>  Yet another great post dissecting one of Spring's oft-misunderstood nuances by Roger Hughes! This post introduces <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/using-spring-mvc%E2%80%99s">Spring @MVC's <CODE>@ModelAttribute</CODE></A>. 
		The attribute can be handy when... what am I doing? <EM>Go</EM>, read the post! It's great!
		 </LI> 
		<lI>  Want to run your Spring application on Google App Engine? Want to use their not-quite-there SQL support through Hibernate? Want Hibernate to not be  painful? Use Spring. This post shows <a href= "http://blog.essaytagger.com/2011/11/spring-hibernate-on-google-app-engines.html">how to use Spring to setup <code>HibernateDao</code> on Google App Engine</a>. It sounds like this particular blogger is only using Spring to make the most of Hibernate, which is a shame.  Spring runs really nicely on Google App Engine, and so users are encouraged to exploit its full power in that environment, too.

		</LI>
		
			<LI> 
				Readers of this column will know that we often try to link to posts about Tomcat administration that are <em>real world</EM>. Why? Because Tomcat's powerful and also the most widely used application server for Java developers, and sometimes developers need to blur the lines between developer and system administrator to develop applications in an environment that faithfully replicates production. 

					This week's link, <a href= "http://java-wisdom.blogspot.com/2010/11/apache-load-balancing-for-tomcat.html">on load balancing with  Apache Tomcat by fronting it with Apache HTTPD</a>, is no different. Great introduction, and a great topic. 

<br />
		At this point, however, I would be remiss if I didn't mention  that the easiest way to get this exact behavior with no configuration at all is to use <a href= "http://cloudfoundry.com/signup?utm_source=springsource_web&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=cloudfoundry-signup">Cloud Foundry</A>, the open source PaaS project. Simply deploy your application to Cloud Foundry and then ratchet up the number of instances of that application. You'll instantly get round robin dispatching among the deployed instances.  This is quick and easy, in development or in production! Just sayin'...!

		<LI> Ashish Sarin, as readers of this column will know, really digs Spring Roo. He's just announced a Spring Roo podcast, and I couldn't be happier. 
			 I'll certainly be checking it out, and you should too. Here's the <a href="http://spring-roo.blogspot.com/2011/10/spring-roo-podcast.html">announcement with details</a>.

		<LI>Chad Lung has put together a great introduction on <A href= "http://java.dzone.com/articles/build-spring-data-project">how to build  a Spring-Data project with MongoDB in under 5 minutes using Netbeans 7 and Maven</a>.  Spring makes it easy, no matter which build tool and IDE you're using, of course, but it's nice to have specific goals in mind when approaching this sort of integration, and this post is <EM>nothing</EM> if not specific! Read on!

	<LI>The United States Navy used Magnolia, the CMS, along with Spring to build their <a href="http://www.navy.com">Navy.com</A> portal and landing page. The web site is - among other things - the focal point of a high volume recruitment campaign here in the US. 
		Magnolia's putting on a webinar  that explains  "how Campbell Ewald (Navy's digital agency) used Magnolia's Blossom module for straightforward app integration and how Blossom enabled Spring developers to work efficiently with Magnolia CMS right from the start."
		This could be interesting indeed. To learn more,  <a href= "http://www.magnolia-cms.com/landing/webinar-navy.html">check out the webinar registration page.</a>

     <P>    Wow! Last week's <a href= "http://www.springone2gx.com">SpringOne 2GX</a> event was sensational. It was an amazing time, and it was - as usual - great to see the Spring community going so strong.  I can't wait until the videos from the event start to appear on <a href= "http://www.infoq.com">InfoQ.com</a>. 
	
	We've got a lot to cover this week, though, so let's get into it!
	 </P> 
  <OL> 
	
	<Li> 
 Don't tell anyone, but even if you missed SpringOne 2GX, the decks for all the talks should be on
          <a hREF ="http://www.springone2gx.com">SpringOne2GX.com</a>, and the videos for all the talks will be on InfoQ.com soon. 

To tide you over in the short term, the deck from 
 	 SpringSource CTO Adrian Colyer's  keynote - "<a href= "http://portal.sliderocket.com/vmware/SpringOne2GX-2011-Opening-Keynote ">Spring yesterday, today, and tomorrow</a>"  -  is available online.   Thanks Adrian! 
	</lI>

	 One of the many big announcements that came from the SpringOne2GX event was	 that of <a href= "http://neo4j.org/spring/">Neo4j 2.0</a>.

	  At <a href= "http://www.springone2gx.com">SpringOne 2GX</A> just last week, <EM>two</EM> different people approached me about their use cases for multi-tenancy with Spring and Hibernate. 
	 Ken DeLong, who I met last week, has written a <a href= "http://www.jroller.com/kenwdelong/entry/multi_tenancy_using_spring_and">blog post on the strategy he took</A> and was kind enough to share with us. Nice job, Ken, and thanks!

<LI> At the JAX London Spring track today, Eberhard Wolff gave an interesting <a href = "http://www.slideshare.net/ewolff/scala-and-spring">talk on using Spring with Scala</A>, and posted the slides. Good stuff and a welcome entry in the ever growing number of use cases for Spring  and Scala.
</LI> 
 <LI> Johnny Ren has posted a high level overview  (no code-level specifics) of the steps to securing a web application using Spring Security over on the JBoss blogs, in 	
<a href= "http://community.jboss.org/people/johnnyren/blog/2011/10/30/understanding-spring-security-and-role-based-access-control"> 

Understanding Spring Security and Role Based Access Control</a>. I think this is useful because it points out some of what's possible with Spring and Spring Security, and you're free from there to pursue the specifics after. Good stuff!

	 Time after time the Spring source code base has been audited by independant third parties. They review aspects of the code like 
	 code coverage,  warnings, etc, and - as often as not - they review how clean the source code itself is. It is, of course, among the cleanest and most reliable code bases in open source. This latest analysis checks the code base for its adherance to GRASP patterns. (I'll spoil the results for you - of course it comes out roses! That doesn't make the analysis any less interesting.) 
	<a href= "http://javadepend.wordpress.com/2011/10/26/spring-the-art-of-using-grasp-patterns/">
	Check it out!</a><br />
	  By the by, for those curious about how the code's stayed so clean and well designed, check out Spring project lead's interview on the <A HREF="http://www.se-radio.net/2008/01/episode-82-organization-of-large-code-bases-with-juergen-hoeller">Software Engineering podcast a few years ago</a>, in which he details his approach to keeping code organized and to evolving it.

		There are lots of goodies in Spring 3.1, but one that has received a lot of attention is the updated testing support. Testing's an important part to
		enterprise software development, and Spring's always made this important task as easy as possible.  Check out the Java Code  Geek's blog on <a href= "http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2011/10/spring-3-testing-with-junit-4.html">Spring 3 Testing with JUnit 4  with <CODE>ContextConfiguration</CODE> and <CODE>AbstractTransactionalJUnit4SpringContextTests</CODE></A>.

 <OL>   <LI>  Spring 3.1.0.RC1 was released last week! And so begins the march to Spring 3.1 GA.   Chris Beams kicked things off with this  
	 <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3279">announcement</a>. Then, Juergen Hoeller, Spring project lead, followed up <A HREF="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/10/12/spring-framework-3-1-rc1-released/">with this blog post detailing the new features.</A>
	 The first release candidate of Spring 3.1 is now available from the Spring <a href="http://maven.springframework.org/milestone" >milestone repository</a> or for direct download <a href="http://www.springsource.com/download/community">via community download page</A>. This release includes new features such as:

	Support for Hibernate 4.0 (up to date with 4.0 CR4), 
	Complete <CODE>TestContext</CODE> framework support for <CODE>@Configuration</CODE> classes,
	Flash scope for Spring MVC, 
	Support for Quartz 2.0,  
	77 bug fixes, 16 new features, and 66 improvements. Wow! To learn more about what's new in Spring 3.1, be sure to <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.1.0.RC1/spring-framework-reference/html/new-in-3.1.html">check out this document.</a>
	 </LI> 
	  <LI> 
	  Martin Lippert today announced the <a  href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3287">release of SpringSource Tool Suite 2.8</a>. The new IDE contains all sorts of features, and updates. It's built on top of  Eclipse Indigo SR1, it
		includes full IDE support for Java 7 (coming with the Eclipse 3.7.1 update),
 		support for Spring 3.1 bean profiles, including validation and navigation,  
		support for Spring 3.1 c-namespace including quick-fixes, validation and content-assist,  
		improved constructor-arg validation and quick-fixes, 
		updated Eclipse Maven integration (m2e 1.0.100), including migration assistance,  
		support for Groovy 1.8.2, and 
		support for Grails 2.0.0.M2. As this  new release bundles m2e (the Eclipse plugin formerly known as <em>m2eclipse</em>), there are <a  href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/10/18/upgrading-maven-integration-for-springsource-tool-suite-2-8-0/">some steps</A> you'll need to be aware of when upgrading.

Readers of this column will remember that 		  <A href="http://www.infoq.com">InfoQ</a> recorded sessions  from the Paris "What's Next," and we got to see  Adrian Colyer's   <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3200">keynote on cloud computing in the enterprise</a>. InfoQ's just released two more videos from Rob Harrop, a core Spring developer and an engineer on RabbitMQ,  and Jags Ramnarayan, chief architect at GemFire.   <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Multi-Platform-Messaging-with-RabbitMQ">Rob   introduced  polyglot messaging with  RabbitMQ</A>, and   <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/SQLFire-Scalable-SQL-instead-of-NoSQL">Jags Ramnaraya introduced SQLFire</a>, the scalable SQL database that offers a compelling alternative to a NOSQL store.

		 <LI> Ramnivas Laddad, from the CloudFoundry team,  <a href= "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/SpringSourceTeamBlog/~3/td3vscam9RA/">introduces the numerous services available on CloudFoundry</a> for Spring developers.
			   Services offered in Cloud Foundry make writing efficient and effective applications possible. When you're writing an application for CloudFoundry, don't worry about <em>whether</EM> there's a service available -   instead focus on  <em>which</EM> service  you'll use. 
	 	 </lI> 
	 <LI>This new post introduces one of the more intriguing tricks you can play with the Spring application context: <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/spring-make-externally-created">Spring: Make an Externally Created Object Available to Beans in applicationContext.xml</A>  If your Spring beans need access to an object that is not created by Spring itself, you can  "inject" it into the context by using a static parent context and registering the object with it. Beans can then reference it just as if it was defined in the application context file.

	 <LI>Micro Cloud Foundry has been updated, and now offers more supported services - including RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL support - which is identical to the <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.com">publicly hosted CloudFoundry.com</A>

		 Spring Data JDBC Extensions with <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3286">Oracle Database Support 1.0.0.RC1</a>  has just been released.  Among the many improvements, there is better documentation chapter for QueryDSL SQL module,
		 OSGi manifests, and updated  slf4j/log4j and other dependencies.
		 </lI>
	 <LI> Spring's Message Listener container has been, and remains, one of the most powerful ways to build JMS applications.  In order to receive JMS messages, Spring provides the concept of message listener containers. These are beans that can be configured to receive messages that arrive on specified <code>javax.jms.Destination</code>s  asynchronously - that is, you don't wait for the messages.   
		<a href= "http://city81.blogspot.com/2011/10/spring-jms-listener-adapters-and.html">This post does a fine job</a> introducing the concepts and configuration required to have your application  notified when a message is received from a JMS broker.

 <LI> The <a href= "http://www.springsource.org/spring-social">Spring Social</a> project's taken on a life of its own! It seems like every week there's a new implementation that's being built on top of the powerful, foundational connection and autorization APIs that Spring Social provides.  
 Google+, the new social network from Google, is an oft-demanded integration. Unfortunately, there was no API available until just recently. In what seems like minutes after the announcement, Bozhidar Bozhanov had rushed in to provide a <A HREF="http://techblog.bozho.net/?p=604">Spring Social API for Google+</a>. Nice job, Bozhidar!  If you want to get started with Spring Social, be sure to check out Spring Social lead Craig Walls' <a href="http://www.springsource.org/video-springsocial">webinar recording introducing Spring Social.</a>

<lI>BSB has written a bit about <a href="http://labs.bsb.com/2011/09/staging-and-business-chunking-with-spring-batch">how to 
use Spring Batch to handle staging of data in a batch job</a>.  It introduces the core SPIs, <CODE>ItemReader</CODE>, <CODE>ItemWriter</CODE>, and <CODE>ItemProcessor</CODE>, and then shows how to seed a batch job using a <CODE>StagingItemProcessor</CODE>. Good stuff! This is another example of how the strong reliance on flexible SPIs make Spring extensible to new use cases that weren't envisioned in the original design.  Nice job, guys!
 </li>
 <LI>  Sivaprasadreddy Katamreddy 
 demonstrates how to go beyond the built-in Spring support for Quartz, the popular open source job scheduling engine, and leverage annotations to <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/spring-and-quartz-integration">drive the registration and configuration of new Quartz jobs</a>.  
  This post is doubly useful: it makes the Spring and Quartz integration as smooth as silk, on par with the inbuilt support for scheduling with Spring's own <CODE>@Scheduled</CODE> annotation, and it shows how - with a little bit of coding, you can leverage Spring's fantastic component model and rich SPIs to extend the framework and build <em>micro-frameworks</EM>.

 <LI>Alex Soto <a href="http://alexsotob.blogspot.com/2011/10/youre-so-sexy-sex-sex-sexy-feel-me-now.html">builds a Yaml <CODE>HttpMessageConverter</CODE></a>. Yaml (short for "Yet another markup language") provides a human-readable and writable representation of data (like JSON, but even simpler). Yaml is a natural choice for REST services, because it's so easy to interact with. The <CODE>HttpMessageConverter</Code> SPI, in Spring's web support, is used to drive how Spring marshals an object over an HTTP request (or response) and vice-vera, from an object into some type of payload that can be encoaded in an HTTP request (or response).

<LI> Ashish Sarin, author of the Spring Roo 1.1 Cookbook from PACKT, has written up <a href="http://spring-roo.blogspot.com/2011/10/quick-introduction-to-aspectj-itd.html">an introduction to the AspectJ inter-type declaration (ITD) language</a>. This is not required reading if you're using Spring Roo, but it is very cool to see what's possible, and having such an able introduction's very helpful!

 <lI> Roger Hughes introduces Spring's <A HREF="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Required.html">@Required annotation.</a> His post explores a <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/using-spring%E2%80%99s-required">not only <em>how</EM> to use the annotation, but <EM>when</EM></a>. It is a compelling read for one of Spring's most powerful gems</A>, and best kept secrets. Nice job, Roger! </li> 
 <LI>Roger Hughes introduces <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/using-aspectj%E2%80%99s-afterthrowing">Spring's AOP support</a>, particularly, the <CODE>@AfterThrowing</CODE> annotation, which lets you intercept a method invocation just after an exception's been thrown but before it's been handled. Fascinating read, and a nice reminder of the power that  bubbles just beneath the surface of the framework.

 What a week! Lots of content and so precious little time, so we'll get right into it. First, some programming notes: SpringSource will be at  JavaOne. If you're there, then be sure to  visit the SpringSource booth in the exhibitors hall and say hi and meet-'n-greet with engineers from SpringSource, yours truly included. Likewise, there is a <EM>lot</EM> of fine content from the SpringSource team at <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3237">JavaOne</a> itself, so make sure to add them to your schedule! 
 </P><P>Finally, what're you guys doing Thursday morning? Say around <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3230">10 AM PST</a> in North America, or <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3229">3 PM GMT</a> in Europe? Well, if you're not busy, let's have a social get together! Just you, me, Craig Walls, and several thousand of our closest friends.   Craig Walls is putting on a  webinar introducing <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-social">Spring Social.</a>  
This webinar will introduce Spring Social essentials such as connecting to service providers and using Spring Social's API bindings. We'll also see how to add provider-based sign in and how to extend Spring Social's service provider support. RSVP ASAP!

	<LI>Faithful readers of this roundup will no doubt know the name Gordon Dickens, who has come in this week with not one, but two posts on using Spring in the cloud this week.
 <a href="http://gordondickens.com/wordpress/2011/09/23/rocket-to-the-cloud-fast-with-roo/">
	The first post</a> introduces using <a href="http://www.springsource.org/roo">Spring Roo</a> with <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.org">CloudFoundry</a>. Very cool! 
	The second post talks about using Spring Roo with <a href="http://gordondickens.com/wordpress/2011/09/26/buzzing-the-cloud-with-cloudbees-and-roo/">CloudBees</a>, an alternative cloud. 
	Spring (and the projects that build on it like Grails and Spring Roo) has always had a strong portability story, and this just exemplifies that feature. Now, if you want to take your application further, and want portability, then definitely consider CloudFoundry as your PaaS choice. Remember, <a href="http://eigwebhosting.com/linode/need-someone-to-transfer-my-heroku-site-to-lt_2790483N59e_Sep2011.html?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed">portability matters</a>!

	One of my favorite features are the template projects, which provide ready-to-use, pre-configured starter projects. To access them, you go to <b>File</B> &gt; <B>New</B> &gt; <b>Spring Template Project</b>, and then choose one. There are lots to choose from - Spring Batch Admin, Spring MVC, etc. 
	However, one of the most popular is sure to be the Spring MVC template, which comes with a ready-to-use Maven <CODE>pom.xml</CODE> that is, well, perhaps a bit overloaded! 
 <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/dissecting-springs-mvc-project">This blog post</a> disects that template's <code>pom.xml</code>, providing guidance for developers who want to know which parts of the <code>pom.xml</code>	 are optional, and what they do. Good stuff! And, I think some of the feedback can be incorporated into the templates in future iterations of STS ;-)

	<LI> <a href ="http://java.dzone.com/articles/aop-and-aspectj-terminology">This post introduces AOP and AspectJ terminology</a> which can be very useful if you're looking to Spring's AOP support for the first time. Good stuff! </LI>

 If that wasn't enough, there's also service-layer support (e.g, you can generate service objects), choice in which type of repository layer is generated (active-record style or traditional repository objects), much improved, very flexible GWT support, MongoDB support, and multi-schema aware database reverse engineering (DBRE) and shell improvements.

<P> What a week!  
	
	And, believe it or not, this week's actually a <EM>calm</EM> week!  
  
We've got a lot of exciting stuff to cover, so let's get to it. 
	
	</p> 

<oL>
	<Li> <a href= "http://www.springsource.org/spring-social/news/1.0.0-released">Spring Social 1.0 has been released!</a>   		
		
		This - the first GA release of the Spring Social framework - is very exciting news!  Spring Social's core API, which includes a connection framework that frees you from managing the delicate OAuth dance,   is stable.  This release also sees the release of two of the integration modules for <B>Twitter</B>  and <B>FaceBook</B>.		 Spring Social project lead Craig Walls talks about the new features in a post, 
		"<a href ="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/09/08/spring-social-1-0-what-a-year-makes/">What a Year Makes.</a>"		
	</li>
 	<li> <a href  = "http://www.springsource.org/node/3228">Spring Integration 2.1. Milestone 1</a> is Now Available! This new release is the first milestone on the march to 2.1, and is packed with new features, including support for <B>RabbitMQ</B>, <B>GemFire</B>, <B>Redis</B> and <B>MongoDB</B>. Check it out!  
	</li>
	<li> 
		There is a lot  of exciting news surrounding <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.org">CloudFoundry</a>! 
		If you want a pretty good digest, check out this post, 
		 <a href="http://www.dzone.com/links/r/cloudfoundry_inks_distribution_and_deployment_dea.html">CloudFoundry Inks Distribution and Deployment Deal</a> or the summary that <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/VMware-Aims-at-PaaS-With-Cloud-Foundry-594624/">Cloud Foundry makes good progress</a>.   
		</li> 
		<LI> A few weeks ago, <a href ="http://www.springsource.org/spring-amqp">Spring AMQP 1.0 went GA</a>, and this week InfoQ's <a href=" http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/09/spring-amqp-1.0-ga">followed it up</a> with a detailed post. Great stuff! 
		</li>
	<li> Andrei Stefan <a href="https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-sqlfire-samples">has reworked the classic Spring PetStore example</a> to use the new <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vfabric-sqlfire/overview.html">vFabric SQLFire driver</a>, which exposes an ANSI SQL 92 layer on top of <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/vfabric-gemfire/overview.html">vFabric GemFire</a>.  As if this wasn't cool enough, he's also introduced the Spring Data JDBC extensions into the code base, reusing the <CODE>QueryDslJdbcTemplate</CODE> which is a version of the classic  <CODE>JdbcTemplate</CoDE> included in the core Spring framework that works with QueryDSL. To see some examples of the reworked code, you should check out <a href="https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-sqlfire-samples/blob/master/jpetstore/src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/jpetstore/dao/springdata/SpringDataItemDao.java">the <code>SpringDataItemDao</code></a> example, and the   <a href="https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-sqlfire-samples/blob/master/jpetstore/src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/jpetstore/dao/springdata/SpringDataAccountDao.java"><COde>SpringDataAccountDao</code></a> example.   
		</li> 
	<li> <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3226">Spring Data JPA 1.0.1 and 1.1.0.M1 Released</a>! The new release includes numerous new features, including    a variety of bugfixes, and improvements mostly around the mapping subsystem and performance, all listed in the  <a href="http://static.springframework.org/spring-data/data-jpa/docs/1.1.0.M1/changelog.txt">changelog</a>. The first milestone of the 1.1 train contains these bug fixes as well of course, adds  <CODE>IgnoreCase</code> as keyword for the query parser and allows users to use that version alongside Spring Data MongoDB 1.0.0.M4 as they both refer to the same version of Spring Data Commons.
   </li>
		<lI> This 
			 <a href="http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2011/09/spring-declarative-transactions-example.html">post</a> 
			from the Java Code Geeks talks about Spring's declarative transaction management using <CODE>@Transactional</CODE>. <CODE>@Transactional</CODE> was  the first annotation supported in the Spring framework, and it is still one of the most popular! Good stuff. For a very detailed look at transaction management using Spring, you might also consult this post <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/08/15/configuring-spring-and-jta-without-full-java-ee/">Configuring Spring and JTA without full Java EE</a>.

	<li>Shaun Abram has a great post on <a href="http://www.shaunabram.com/multiple-tomcat-instances/">how to setup multiple Tomcat instances</a>. Nice post, Shaun!   </li>
	<li>  
		Were you in Norway last week for the <a href="http://jz10.java.no/">JavaZone conference</a>? Well, you missed a lot of fun. But don't fear, you can still reap the rewards! There are some great Spring talks and they're all recorded live, available for anyone to watch, on <a href="http://vimeo.com/javazone/videos">the JavaZone Vimeo</a> page. 
		
		There are talks on <a href="http://vimeo.com/28760638">Spring configuration</a>, the <a href="http://vimeo.com/28721724">Spring 3.1 caching abstraction</a>, <a href="http://vimeo.com/28795501">Spring Integration with CloudFoundry</a> (bonus: the talk, <a href="http://vimeo.com/28606559">"Event Driven Architecture with the Spring framework"</a> from last year is also available!), <a  href="http://vimeo.com/28793832">Spring Data</a>, and <a href="http://vimeo.com/28769090">Polyglot Persistence</a>, all available in English. If you speak Norwegian, then there's ample content for you, as well, including a talk on <a href="http://vimeo.com/28764778">Spring Java configuration in Scala</a>, and on performance gains with <a href="http://vimeo.com/28760363">Spring Batch</a>.  I think I saw some others, too, but as I don't speak Norwegian, I can't be too sure! Enjoy!

		 <lI>If you want to use the Micro CloudFoundry instance completely offline,  <a href ="http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/post/9962996319/working-offline-with-micro-cloud-foundry">this post has a good walkthrough of the steps required</a>.

    <P> Wow! Where's the time gone? September is here already and we have <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3223">SpringOne 2GX 2011</a> in our sights! This year's conference will be bigger and better than ever! Besides all the great new content on the latest and greatest technologies (after all, <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-data">Spring Data</a> was only <EM>one</EM> of the big announcements to come out of SpringOne 2GX last year, and you wouldn't believe how far that project's come since!) that are sure to be at this year's event, this year's venue is also noteworthy: SpringOne 2GX will be in the heart of downtown Chicago, in the middle of one of the most beautiful and exciting cities in the US. </p>
<p>...Did I mention that there's a <a href="http://springone2gx.com/conference/chicago/2011/10/register">$200 discount if you register now?</a></p>

<UL> <LI> InfoQ.com's posted  an <a href ="http://www.infoq.com/articles/Adrian-Colyer-cloud-computing">interview with SpringSource CTO Adrian Colyer</a> on the cloud, what's next and more. Great interview, and for those that haven't already seen it, you're encouraged to check out Adrian's presentation, also on <A href= "http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Enterprise-Apps-in-2011-and-Beyond">InfoQ.com</a> </li>
 <LI> There are not one, not two,  not three, but <EM>four</EM> webinars from world-renowned speakers and technologists this month presented by SpringSource: Spring Data JPA, Tuning Java for Virtual Environments, Modern Data Management and Spring Social. Make <a href="http://www.springsource.com/newsevents/webinars">sure to mark  your calendar!</a>  
	</li>
 <LI> 
 <a href= "http://www.springsource.org/node/3225">Spring Data MongoDB 1.0.0 M4's</a> been released!  
	
	The new release is jam packed with interesting new features, including support for map-reduce operations in <CODE>MongoTemplate</CODE>,
	a means to use externalized queries to be executed by repositories,
	support for <CODE>geoNear</CODE> queries on <CODE>MongoTemplate</CODE> and the repositories,
	a new <CODE>DocumentCallbackHandler</CODE> interface on <CODE>MongoTemplate</CODE>, 
	a DB wide <CODE>WriteConcern</CODE> can now be configured on the <CODE>SimpleDbFactory</CODE>,
	a <CODE>WriteConcern</CODE> configurable on <CODE>MongoFactoryBean</CODE>,
	 a <CODE>QuerydslRepositorySupport</CODE> base class to ease implementing Querydsl  based repositories, and a 
	configurable <CODE>TypeMapper</CODE> interface to control how type information is written and retrieved to and from Mongo documents. 
	  
	</LI>
  
  <li> <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3226">Spring Data JPA 1.0.1 and 1.1.0.M1 have been released</a>! The 1.0.1 release has the bug fixes of course, but the first milestone of the 1.1 train adds new improvements including compatibility with the above mentions Spring Data MongoDB milestone.   
  </li>
  
 <LI> Spring Roo <a href="https://jira.springsource.org/browse/ROO-301">1.2, M1's support for choosing between the active-record style or services-style</a> of data access is imminent!  
I'm very excited. The new features (as described by Spring Roo engineer Stefan Schmidt  on the JIRA) are: 
       
<div>

<UL>
	 <LI>  'Active Record'-style JPA persistent domain entities (default persistence provider) </li>
     <li> JPA repositories backed by <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/jpa">Spring Data JPA</a> (formerly Hades) </li>
	 <li> MongoDB repositories backed by Spring Data MongoDB (see ROO-2693) </LI> 
</UL>
	Stefan continues,   
"All three persistence options are integrated through a new layer service offered by Roo. This means that other add-ons will be able to automatically wire themselves to use these repositories once they are detected in the project. At present a new service layer add-on, the Spring MVC add-on, the integration test and data on demand add-ons (test support for mongo repositories is not yet offered) are already integrated with the new layering support. The GWT and (to be released) JSF add-ons will follow soon." </div>
 	
 </LI>  
 <LI><a href="http://www.tomcatexpert.com/blog/2011/09/02/apache-tomcat-7021-released">Apache Tomcat 7.0.21 released!</a>  
	 The new version has bug and security fixes, and it's highly recommended that users update as soon as possible. 
	
	</lI>
 <LI> 
	 <a href="http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2011/09/evolution-of-spring-dependency.html">This post walks through the evolution of dependency injection options</a>
 
	in Spring core from XML to Java configuration and everything in between! Good stuff, and I particularly like the last example, where he demonstrates using Spring and Scala! 
	</li>
  <LI> Experiencing an issue using Spring MVC Portlet in conjunction with Liferay ServiceBuilder? 
		<a href="http://xebee.xebia.in/2011/09/04/developing-portlets-using-spring-portlet-mvc-and-liferay-servicebuilder/">This post</a> explains the problem and provides an easy fix. My favorite part about the Spring framework? It accounts for the problems of today and is built to be flexible to account for the problems of tomorrow. 
	</LI>
  <li>This post introduces <a href="http://nocturnsoft.com/devblog/?p=1520">how to setup a RESTful service</a> using Spring MVC and the marshalling support in Spring OXM from NetBeans. Nice tutorial! </li>
  <LI> I know this is a little older post, but it's a neat tutorial on using <a href= "http://www.springsourcery.org/springSourcery/content/viewContent,1,42.html?random=2937">Gradle and SpringSource Tool Suite to build a web application.</a> 
	 However, I am happy to report that this tutorial is no longer as helpful as it was because the 2.7.0x releases of SpringSource Tool Suite have included <EM>native</EM> Gradle support. For more on that, readers might <a href="http://static.springsource.org/sts/docs/2.7.0.M1/reference/html/gradle/installation.html">also consult this post which explains</a> how to get the Gradle support.
	 </li>
  <LI> Spring's AOP support is a fantastic way to add cross-cutting functionality to your application. This post introduces a 
 <a href="http://singztechmusings.wordpress.com/2011/09/04/aspect-oriented-programming-with-aspectj-and-spring-aop-a-simple-example/">very simple example using Spring's AOP support</a>. Check it out! </a>
