<P>  Welcome to another edition of <EM>
"This Week in Spring" </EM>  There's a lot to get to, so we'll get to it. A quick note: if you're at VMworld 2011 in sunny Las Vegas, come on over to the Cloud Application Platform booth and say hi.  
	 </P>
<OL> 
	<LI>What a week for <a HREF="http://www.cloudfoundry.org">CloudFoundry</A>! The week saw the release and availability of <a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.com/micro">Micro Cloud Foundry,</a> the freely downloadable <EM>"PaaS-on-a-stick."</EM>  
		 Micro Cloud Foundry is a complete, local version of the popular, open source Platform as a Service that lets developers run a full featured cloud on their Mac or PC. Using Micro Cloud Foundry developers can build end-to-end cloud applications locally, without the hassles of configuring middleware while preserving the choice of where to deploy and the ability to scale their applications without changing a line of code.
		
  To learn more about the Micro Cloud Foundry, check out these three blog posts introducing Micro Cloud Foundry to <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/08/24/micro-cloud-foundry-for-spring-developers/">Spring developers</a> and <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/08/24/using-micro-cloud-foundry-from-grails/">Grails developers</a>, and introducing the <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3215">support for Micro CloudFoundry in SpringSource Tool Suite</a>.
		
		</li> 
		
		<LI>Thomas Risberg blogged today about <A HREF="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/08/30/using-postgres-on-cloud-foundry/">using PostgreSQL on Cloud Foundry</a>. The recently announced  PostgreSQL support   makes CloudFoundry the natural place to deploy your enterprise applications: between MySQL and PostgreSQL there's very likely few speed or feature that you can't match on CloudFoundry. <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.com">Try it out today!</a>  
			
		 </LI><LI> Mark Thomas had an article on <a href="http://tomcatexpert.com">Tomcat Expert</a> last week about  <A href="http://www.tomcatexpert.com/blog/2011/08/25/apache-tomcat-8-and-java-7-will-they-work-together">Tomcat 8 and Java 7</a>, answering the  question: <EM>will they work together</EM>? 
		 
		</LI>
		 <LI>Roy Clarkson, lead of the Spring Android project, <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/08/26/clean-code-with-android/">recently blogged about the various dependency injection options for Android</A> and how to write cleaner code. Check it out for a look at the modern Android developers toolkit. 
			
			</LI>
		<LI> Spring provides many ways to support configuration. Spring 2.5 enhanced the options available with <EM>stereotypes</EM>, which let you 
				specify a marker annotation as a way to define an injection site.
				This <a href="http://code-on.blogspot.com/2011/08/how-to-use-type-safe-dependency.html">very nice blog post</a> first introduces some of the earlier ways to make maximum use of the type system with <CODE>@Autowired</CODE>, then introduces the <EM>stereotype</EM> model, cleanly and consistently. 
				I wholly recommend it for a great look at an easy way to achieve  
				cleaner code.
			</LI> 
		<LI> 
		   In addition to the MicroCloud, last week saw <A HREF="http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/post/9374366916/cloud-foundry-adds-php-and-python-through-community">the announcement</A> of the availability of <a href="http://www.appfog.com/">PHP</a> and <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">Python</a> support through    community CloudFoundry providers. 
			 This is an ideal situation for developers on those platforms and if you've always wanted first-class support for Python and PHP on a cloud, this release is for you! And, of course, if you're a Python developer, you should no  doubt be looking at <a href="http://springpython.webfactional.com/">Spring Python</a>, the <EM>Pythonic</EM>		port of the Spring framework. 
		</LI>
		<LI> Last week, Alan Stewart, lead of the Spring Roo project, <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3217">announced the availability</a> of the O'REILLY book, <EM>Getting Started with Spring Roo</EM>, that my co-author Steve Mayzak and I put together. O'REILLY worked closely with us to help make the book concise, and useful. O'REILLY have graciously agreed to make the book  <a HREf= "http://spring-roo-repository.springsource.org/Getting_Started_with_Roo.pdf">available for free download here</a>, as a <CODE>.PDF</CODE>. 
			 Readers who want an alternative e-reader-specific format or want to get a print copy of the book on-demand may of course pursue those options at the <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920020981">O'Reilly page for the book</a>. 
			The book features an introduction to Spring Roo as well as an introduction to two of the many powerful, new addons being developed for Spring Roo: the Spring Data Neo4j addon, and the Vaadin web framework addon. 			 
			</li>
			<LI>
				<A href ="http://www.springsource.org/node/3218">Virgo 3.0 and Gemini Web 2.0</a> have been released. 
					The theme of Virgo 3.0 is better integration with EclipseRT technologies. To that end, we have created a Jetty variant of the Virgo web server and have switched from Felix to Equinox implementations of some OSGi services. 
					Gemini Web and the Tomcat variant of the Virgo web server have been upgraded to Tomcat 7 and Servlet 3.0.			 
			</LI>
			<LI> 
			 <A href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3219">Spring AMQP 1.0 GA has been released!</A> 
			 I don't know about you guys, but I've been waiting for this one for a <EM>looong</EM> time. RabbitMQ  is one of the  most powerful messaging options available to enterprise Java developers today in traditional Spring applications <A href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/08/16/chatting-in-the-cloud-part-1/">as well as in the cloud.</a>  
				 Spring AMQP provides the idiomatic Spring support for RabbitMQ, including support for a <CODE>PlatformTransactionManager</CODE> abstraction, 
				and a message listener container abstraction similar to the support available for JMS.
				The GA release of the Spring AMQP integration clears the way for the inclusion of the Spring Integration AMQP support in the imminent  Spring Integration 2.1. Powerful stuff! Developers looking to get started with messaging in Spring might take a look at <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/01/25/green-beans-getting-started-with-enterprise-messaging-and-spring/">this GreenBeans post ("Getting Started with Enterprise Messaging with Spring")</a>, which may be a bit out of date but provides a clear, concise introduction to the relevant concepts and options for both AMQP and JMS integration with Spring. 
			</LI>
			
			<LI><A href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3221">Spring GemFire 1.1.0.M2 has been released!</a>
				
				This new release includes dedicated support for continuous query (Message Driven POJOs for GemFire), extensive client cache support,

	Job scheduling support in Spring's always been pretty robust, historically supporting Quartz, and  - from Spring 3.0 and later - supporting  
	the <CODE>@Scheduled</CODE> annotation. However, there is always room for improvement, <a href="http://techblog.bozho.net/?p=452">and this blog</a>	
	explores this, even <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6788811/taskscheduler-scheduled-and-quartz/6840970#6840970">linking to code</a> that would allow you to build on core Spring, and get <CODE>@Scheduled</CODE>-like ease-of-use  
	 while delegating to Quartz's power. 
	Even if you're not interested in job scheduling, this post serves as a fine example of how anybody can build on the rich lifecycle hooks and component model to extend Spring's API for your own application using the same hooks as the framework itself uses.
	Good stuff!

	 A blogger, Roger Hughes, has written up a string of blogs recently that are really insightful! 
	 The <a href="http://www.captaindebug.com/2011/08/using-spring-3-numberformat-annotation.html">first post</A> introduces  Spring 3's <CODE>@NumberFormat</CODE>. The <a href="http://www.captaindebug.com/2011/08/using-spring-3-datetimeformat.html">second</A>  introduces Spring 3's <CODE>@DateTimeFormat</CODE></A> annotation.  The <a href="http://www.captaindebug.com/2011/08/is-convention-over-configuration-going.html">third post</A>  introduces Spring MVC's <CODE>Conventions</CODE> class, which is at the heart of some of the major convention-over-configuration centric changes seen in recent Spring MVC releases that let you, for example, add any object to the <CODE>Model</CODE> that is made available to the view and omit the name used to store that model attribute, deferring to the <CODe>Conventions</CODE> class to provide a sane name based on the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/52811942/53/Capitalization-of-inferred-names">JavaBeans specification</A>.    
		
 In this latest post, he cautions that while using the conventions in some cases can be very helpful (such as with <CODE>&lt;mvc:annotation-driven/&gt;</CODE>),  using some defaults can cause confusion. This is a fair point, and it's nice to have the choice, either way.

	I like <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.org">CloudFoundry.</a> Others may not be using CloudFoundry, as it is relatively new. Some might still be using Google App Engine, for example. And that's OK. Spring always has been, and will continue to be, about portability and choice. So it is great to see a post that demonstrates <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3207">it is easy to get Spring Roo applications running on Google App Engine</a>, too!  </LI>
	
<LI> The Spring Integration repository has changed addresses! Formerly, the repository was hosted on <a href="http://git.springsource.org">git.SpringSource.org</a>, but it is now hosted under the 	<a href="https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-integration">SpringSource Github.com presence</a>.
	</LI>  
	<LI>
 Ken Rimple <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/now-you-can-choose">has another great post</a>, this time on the upcoming Spring Roo 1.2 release, which features support for both the <A HREF ="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html">ActiveRecord</A>-style entities that Roo has traditionally generated as well as services, which many will no doubt be familiar with. While it's always been possible to use services in conjunction with Spring Roo, this new release makes it a natural part of the workflow.

	<LI> 
	Agile developer Tarun Sapra, at Xebia India, has <a href="http://tarunsapra.wordpress.com/2011/08/21/spring-singleton-request-session-beans-and-thread-safety/">written a nice post</a> on the golden rule of when to use to Spring's <CODE>singleton</CODE> concept: only use singletons for beans that don't have to have <EM>client-specific</EM> state. While he poses the golden rule slightly differently, I think the distinction is important. Spring beans can themselves maintain state, but they must guard that state from mutations by multiple (and often concurrent) clients. 

	A lot of times, too, Spring lets you work as though you have client-specific state, but are in fact using a singleton. An example of this is in the way Spring supports injection of the JPA <CODE>EntityManager</CODE>, which is <EM>not</EM> thread-safe. Spring intercepts calls to the EntityManager proxy that's injected and then, in a thread-local, creates an EntityManager so that each request <em>effectively</em> has client-specific state, but they can program in terms of single-threaded access. 
  That said, this post is a very good read.

		TomcatExpert.com comments on the <a href="http://www.tomcatexpert.com/blog/2011/08/17/new-closemethod-jndi-resources">support for explicit release of JNDI resources in Apache Tomcat</a>.
		Apache Tomcat 7 contains a number of new features around database connection pooling, which help administrators keep their application available and serving content, collecting customer information, and supporting their applications. The main one that has garnered a lot of attention is the new JDBC Connection Pool feature introduced by Filip Hanik last year. Another connection pool attribute not yet discussed here on TomcatExpert.com is the new <CODE>closeMethod</CODE> for speeding up the closing of JNDI resources that would otherwise be closed during garbage collection.

		<LI> This <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/x-springandroid/index.html">post</A> by Deepak Vohra on IBM's DeveloperWorks has some great information on using Spring Android's <CODE>RestTemplate</CODE> support to consume RESTful web services (which, in this example, were developed using JAX-RS). Interoperability is king, and Spring's REST support makes it easy.
</LI>

	<LI><a href="http://www.dzone.com/links/r/spring_integration_with_mvc_freemarker_jsp_webser.html">This fantastic post covers using  FreeMarker</a> (via the <CODE>org.springframework.web.servlet.view.freemarker.FreeMarkerViewResolver</CODE> view resolver) for Spring MVC views</a>. I like FreeMarker, and it has a lot to offer compared to straight <CODE>JSP</CODE> (and even compared to straight <CODE>JSPX</CODE>!) The take away, for me, is that Spring MVC supports lots of options, and provides SPIs that make it very simple to integrate new technology for each of the core pieces of the integration.
 Great stuff!	</lI>

		<a href="http://www.tomcatexpert.com/blog/2011/08/19/apache-tomcat-6033-released">Apache Tomcat 6.0.33 has been released!</a>
		 
		
		 

		Apache Tomcat 6.0.33 is primarily a security and bug fix release. All users of older versions of the Tomcat 6.0 family should upgrade to 6.0.33.

		Note that is version has 4 zip binaries: a generic one and three bundled with Tomcat native binaries for different CPU architectures.

		Apache Tomcat 6.0 includes new features over Apache Tomcat 5.5, including support for the new Servlet 2.5 and JSP 2.1 specifications, a refactored clustering implementation, advanced IO features, and improvements in memory usage.

	<LI> Speaking of Spring MVC 3.1, I pinged Rossen Stoyanchev  and Keith Donald on the Spring web team to see what's cooking. I was really happy to learn that   flash map support will be available in Spring MVC 3.1. The flash map support is simple: it allows you to persist a value beyond a single redirect, which then expires. This has historically been useful in implementing the redirect-after-post pattern, to avoid having somebody double submit a POST submission should they try to use the back button. Faithful readers and fellow code spelunkers will know that the <a href="https://github.com/SpringSource/greenhouse">GreenHouse</a> project has an implementation of this type of functionality already available. If you can't stand the (short) wait, you might consider using that until the more sophisticated, powerful offering is available, integrated into Spring MVC 3.1, directly.  </li> 
 
		<LI>Are you looking at Groovy? Want to learn more? There are many great resources, and entirely by accident, I've just stumbled upon another.  
			Check out <a href="http://groovycasts.org/">Groovy Casts.</a> 
			</LI> 
 
	<LI>  This is a post that's all too common these days: what could possibly compel me to use CDI and JavaEE6? In this post,  <a href="http://java.dzone.com/news/do-you-need-move-spring-java"><em>Do I need to move from Spring to Java EE 6?</em></a>,  the answer, of course, is an ebullient, "No!" 
 This post explain's one architect's reasoning. Are you fleeing from CDI and JavaEE6, and moving your application to Spring? Or, simply want to reuse code from an existing CDI application, in particular CDI's decorators? Then check out this post for an <a href="http://niklasschlimm.blogspot.com/2011/08/jsr-299-cdi-decorators-for-spring-beans.html">approach to reuse CDI's decorator's inside of Spring.</a> 
  This support is limited in scope, of course,  but it's one less thing you'd have to work on when moving to Spring. An ideal migration will take advantage of the far more robust AOP support available in Spring itself.

	<LI>  O'REILLY's just published a small getting started book for Spring, <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781449306403"><em>Just Spring</em>.</a> 
		 I haven't had a chance to look at it, but the TOC seems promising -- it looks like a direct, 80%-centric look at using the Spring framework. Check it out.

	</LI> 	
	<LI> Your humble editor was asked recently about Spring's <code>FactoryBean&lt;T&gt;</code> 
		 interface: what's it for? and why? I've written a two part  post on the specifics of the <a href ="http://joshlong.com/jl/blogPost/spring_corner_whats_a_factory_bean.html">interface</a> as well as the often <a href="http://joshlong.com/jl/blogPost/spring_corner_beyond_the_factorybean.html">more suitable alternatives in Spring 3.0 and Spring 3.1.</a>		   
	</LI>
	 <LI>    Continuing with his Scala and Spring integration theme -   Oleg Zhurakousky  has written up a post on implementing a <CODE>FactoryBean</CODE> with Spring in Scala. 
		This is absolutely great, as it opens up a powerful part of the Spring framework to Scala development. Check it out!
		</LI>
	 <li> Loiane Groner -  the ESJUG (Espirito Santo Java Users Group) and CampinasJUG (Campinas Java Users Group) leader and coordinator - has written this fantastic  post explaining how to use <a href= "http://java.dzone.com/articles/extjs-4-file-upload-spring-mvc">the ExtJS 4 upload component on the frontend with a Spring MVC 3</a> backend. Very pragmatic, cool stuff, and complete with lots of code!

	 with Spring</a>
			  This is fantastic, and useful!  
		</LI> 
		<LI> Spring MVC is very powerful and easily  employed in your application (in Spring 3.0, you need only specify <CODE>&lt;mvc:annotation-driven /&gt;</CODE> to enable it; alternatively in Spring 3.1, you need only specify  <CODE>@EnableWebMvc</CODE> to enable it). It's also very flexible, and can be configured in many ways. One of the pluggability planes is the view technology: there are common recipes for using JSP, Tiles, Velocity, FreeMarker, XML, JSON, PDFs, Excel spreadsheets and much more for Spring MVCs. If none of these meet your requirements, you can look to the open source community to leverage others, <a href="http://www.thymeleaf.org/"> including one called Thymeleaf.</a>  Here's <a href="http://www.thymeleaf.org/thvsjsp.html">a comparison of Thymeleaf to JSP<a> as a Spring MVC view technology.  Here's a tutorial on <a href=  "http://www.thymeleaf.org/thymeleafspring3.html">  setting up the view technology in Spring MVC.</a> Powerful, and simple!  
 Check it out!		Users of Tapestry's templates as well as JSF's Facelets will see a lot to like in
 this view template technology - check it out!	</li>

<LI> 
	<a href="http://www.tomcatexpert.com">
TomcatExpert.com</a> has a great post on the  <a href= "http://www.tomcatexpert.com/blog/2011/07/20/security-lifecycle-listener"> Security Lifecycle listener.</a>
 
		Apache Tomcat 7 includes several security updates that further harden the application server that came directly from the Bugzilla queue. One new feature, the Security Lifecycle Listener, helps ensure that Tomcat is started in a reasonably secure way.

		<LI><a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3180">Spring Data Redis 1.0.0.M4 has been released</a>  
				The new release features several improvements. My favorite? A Spring 3.1 <CODE>CacheManager</CODE> implementation that uses Redis! Out of the box, <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/02/23/spring-3-1-m1-caching/">Spring 3.1's cache abstraction</a> supports a <CODE>CacheManager</CODE> implementation based on the <CODE>java.util.Map&lt;K,V&gt;</code> interface, and an Ehcache implementation. The <A href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-gemfire">Spring Gemfire</a> project ships with a <CODE>CacheManager</CODE> implementation that delegates to GemFire, as well. This new Redis implementation adds to the raft of options available already, and Spring 3.1's not even GA!

			<LI>
			Speaking of Redis, check out this upcoming webinar, <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3179">Getting Started with Spring Data Redis.</a> 
			 From the description, "This webinar will introduce Redis, its data structures, the fundamental concepts behind it and the Redis support in Spring Data, and will showcase how easy it is to get started and scale out into a cloud environment such as Cloud Foundry." Be sure to tune in!

	<LI><a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3165">The Spring BlazeDS Integration, 1.5 GA</a> has just been released! 
		 This release has been in the works for a while, and includes lots of cool features. If you're a user depending on the Spring Flex integration that makes it easy to interact with Spring services from Flex-based RIA clients, then you should definitely upgrade. This release has enhanced AMF serialization support, better, more natural, and more exhaustive Spring Security support, easier customization and namespace-supported configuration of framework-provided services, support for reading and writing AMF content with RESTful Spring MVC <CODE>@Controllers</code>, upgraded minimum dependencies to Spring 3.0, BlazeDS 4.0, Spring Security 3.0, and Spring Integration 2.0 and a complete revision of the Maven-based Test Drive samples, including an update across the board to use Flex 4, and a new sample to demonstrate the RESTful programming model.  </li>

        Tomcat Expert has a very interesting post on using <a href="http://www.tomcatexpert.com/blog/2011/06/22/windows-authentication-apache-tomcat">Windows authentication in Tomcat 7</a>. Check it out! </li>

	<LI> Did you know that you could import other Spring <CODE>@Configuration</CODE>-based configuration classes, just as you might import another XML-based configuration class? For details, <a href="http://www.mkyong.com/spring3/spring-3-javaconfig-import-example/">check out this blog.</a>  </LI>
  
	<LI>SpringSource has put up <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh_9RlKjfkU">a video introducing the Spring Roo Vaadin addon</a> to help created Vaadin-based web applications quickly with Spring Roo. Be sure to <a href="">subscribe to the SpringSourceDev</a> channal for the all the latest videos.</li>   




	<LI>Phil  Webb's started a series of blog posts around the idea of taking the Spring Webflow <code>JsfView</code> a step further. The <code>JsfView</code> already works, but it's stateless, and doesn't handle JSF postbacks correctly. The work described in this <a href="http://coderphil.wordpress.com/2011/06/18/">blog</a> expands upon the existing support, outlining the problem and parts of the solution.  He continuous, expanding upon the previous ideas, <a href="http://coderphil.wordpress.com/2011/06/20/">in this blog.</a>

 Welcome back to yet another This Week in Spring. SpringSource is out in full force at JAX San Jose this week and we will be at OSCON, in July. These events are  great avenues for us to connect with the userbase.   As usual, we've got a nice complement of stuff to cover this week, so let's get to it! 
  </p> 
   
<ol>    

          <LI>  There has been loads of interest and discussion surrounding last week's <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/06/09/spring-framework-3-1-m2-released/">Spring 3.1 second milestone</a>.  Sam Brannen writes about the <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/06/21/spring-3-1-m2-testing-with-configuration-classes-and-profiles"> new testing support</a> which is a great follow on to the previous posts about <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/06/10/spring-3-1-m2-configuration-enhancements/">configuration enhancements</a> and <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/06/13/spring-3-1-m2-spring-mvc-enhancements-2/">Spring MVC updates</a>.  
          </LI>

         <LI>
            Alex (from the blog "javaaddicto") has also written about the new features in Spring 3.1, and particularly the new support in Spring 3.1 M2 for   <a href="http://alexsotob.blogspot.com/2011/06/its-strange-but-its-true-i-cant-get.html">XML-free web applications in Spring MVC. </a> This is very cool! Check it out.

       </LI> 
        
        <LI> Hot on the heels of the vFabric 5 release, Chris Harris has written up a good look at how to use the new SQLFire to <a href="http://cjharris5.blogspot.com/2011/06/grails-sqlfire-quickstart.html">build a Grails CRUD application</a>.
    </LI>

  <li>Manning has just released the third edition of SpringSource's very own Craig Walls' <a href="http://www.manning.com/walls4/">Spring in Action</a>. Good stuff, check it out!
       </li> 

    <li>

 <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/jpa">Spring Data JPA</a> (formerly, "Hades"), RC1 has just been released! It features, among other things, improved repository interface programming model (transactions at implementation, no need to extend JpaRepository anymore),  improved parameter binding for created queries, performance improvement in inspecting annotations,  improved detection of domain class from method return types,  and much more. <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3157">Check out the release announcement.</a> </li>

Who wouldn't?  <a href="http://vaadin.com/book/-/page/rapid.cloudfoundry.html">Check  out this doc</a> that explains how to setup the toolchain (including <A href="http://www.springsource.com/developer/sts">SpringSource Tool Suite</A>) and build a web application from code, all the way to the cloud.  </li>

        
        <LI>
The AMIS blog has an interesting post on <a href="http://technology.amis.nl/blog/12306/leveraging-spring-beans-in-adf-faces-applications-and-using-the-spring-propertyplaceholderconfigurer-bean-to-dynamically-configure-bean-properties-from-external-files">how to access and leverage Spring beans from Oracle ADF Faces-based JSF applications</a>. The blog is a bit out of date - in that it covers Spring 2.5, but could prove useful to users of that framework and technology. Note that - while this approach outlines a tooling-centric approach to adding the libraries and so on, the crux of the Spring / JSF integration is bundled with the core Spring framework as an expression resolver delegate, <code>org.springframework.web.jsf.el.SpringBeanFacesELResolver</code>, which the article does introduce. Very cool, generally, and the setup in Spring 3.x is not generally different, to this is useful for users of newer (and older!) versions.

  <p>  Welcome back to another installment of "This Week in Spring," and what a week it's been! This last week saw the release of the  <b>Spring 3.1 M2</b> <EM>and</EM> <b>vFabric 5</b>! Lots of exciting stuff to talk about there,  as well as general community news, so let's get to it! 
  </p> 
   
<ol>    
   <li>  Today VMware <a href="http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/vmware-introduces-vfabric-5-integrated-application-platform-virtual-cloud-environments-nyse-vmw-1526312.htm">announced</a> the release of <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vfabric/overview.html">VMware vFabric 5</a>, the application platform that defines the future of enterprise Java for cloud and virtualized execution environments. vFabric 5 contains many of the technologies that the Spring community is already familiar with including <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/data-center-virtualization/vfabric-tcserver/overview.html">tc Server</a>, <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vfabric-hyperic/overview.html">Hyperic</a>, <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vfabric-gemfire/overview.html">GemFire</a>, and <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vfabric-rabbitmq/overview.html">RabbitMQ</a>, but now adds some new technology. 

<ul>
<li><strong>Elastic Memory for Java</strong> (EM4J): a new capability for tc Server that provides a completely new level of coordination between the application server and the underlying virtual machine. EM4J uses the underlying vSphere virtualization to overcome some of the limitations of the Java's static memory heap.</li>
<li><strong>Spring Insight Operations</strong>: leverages the same code-level tracing technology from the <a href="/insight">Spring Insight</a> project but pulls together information from multiple application servers into a single console with roll-up views, drill downs, and historical comparisons ready for production systems.</li>
<li><strong>SQLFire</strong>: <a href="http://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/appplatform/vfabric_sqlfire">vFabric SQLFire</a> leverages the time-tested vFabric GemFire underpinnings providing data at memory speed and horizontal scale but vFabric SQLFire adds familiar and standard SQL and JDBC interfaces to the service. </li>

</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.springsource.com/author/rodj/">Rod Johnson</a> discusses all the details of the release in his <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/06/14/announcing-vfabric-5/">latest blog</a>. Be sure to check out the latest release and try it out.</p>
   
</li>
   <li>
     <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/06/09/spring-framework-3-1-m2-released/">Spring core lead Juergen Hoeller has announced that Spring 3.1.0 M2 has been released</a>! At long last, the next step on the steady march to Spring 3.1 GA! The new release is as feature-packed as the last one, with a long list of major new features including (but definitely not limited to!) improved Java configuration support, XML-free and hassle-free Servlet 3.0-based Spring MVC application bootstrapping, new <CODE>Builder</CODE> APIs for JPA and Hibernate, and much, much more! Check out the   <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3149">release announcement here</a> and get the bits from your build dependency management tool of choice or <a href="http://www.springsource.com/download/community">the download page</a>
    </li> 
    
    <LI> Hot on the heels of the Spring 3.1 release announcement, <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/06/10/spring-3-1-m2-configuration-enhancements/">Chris Beams chimes in</a> on the much-improved Java-centric configuration model in Spring 3.1, M2, even as compared to M1! The features are really starting to come together to make this one of the smoothest, well arranged releases, yet! </LI> 
    
    <lI> 
   <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/06/13/spring-3-1-m2-spring-mvc-enhancements-2/">Spring 3.1 M2 represents a marked improvement in core Spring, as well as Spring MVC!</a>  Rossen Stoyanchev chimes in to introduce the numerous (truly, you'll need to read the detailed blog to get an idea - I won't even bother trying to enumerate them all here!) new features in Spring MVC 3.1 M2, including XML-free web applications on Servlet 3.0 containers. Check it out! 
    </lI>
  
 <li><a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3151">SpringSource Tool Suite 2.7.0.M2  has been released</a>! The new release boasts  improved CloudFoundry support and many Grails features, including Grails 1.4 support, Grails-aware Rename Type refactoring, improved content-assist for GSPs, and improved Gradle support. Check it out!</li>
   
     <LI>Using Spring Roo? Want to shape it's future? Now's a good time to provide input! The Spring Roo team wants you to fill out a <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3150">quick survey on the direction of Spring Roo.</a></LI>
  
   <LI><a href="http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?110163-Spring-Data-Document-with-MongoDB-Support-1.0.0.M3-Released">Spring Data Document with MongoDB Support, 1.0.0.M3, has been released!</a> From the announcement, <blockquote>The changes and new features in Spring Data Document 1.0.0.M3 includes much improved mapping and conversion support. The <CODE>MappingMongoConverter</CODE> is now the default converter used by the <Code>MongoTemplate </Code> and the <CODE>SimpleMongoConverter</CODE> has been deprecated and will be removed. The concept of a default collection name has also been removed and all operations of the <code>MongoTemplate</code> are based on the collection name used for the entity class that is the target of the operation. The collection name used for an entity class defaults to the class name starting with a lower-case letter but it can be customized using the <code>@Document</code> annotation.  
</blockquote>

        <LI>
    <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3152">Spring Data Graph 1.1.0.M1 with Neo4j Support</a> has been released! As the announcement summarizes, <blockquote>The Graph Neo4j module provides integration with the Neo4j graph database. Back in 2010, Rod Johnson and Emil Eifrem started brainstorming about Spring and Neo4j integration including transparent persistence and cross-store support. After an initial prototype it has been further developed in close cooperation between the VMware and Neo Technology development teams.</blockquote> The new release includes dependency updates, support for the Neo4J query language called Cypher, self-relationships and much more! Check it out!

   <li> Using Spring? Want to build Swing applications, or at least, to build Swing applications with some data-driven 
 content and to manage those interactions with Spring? Check out <a href="http://www.jdal.org/">JDAL</a>, a library with utilities geared towards doing just that! 
       According to the website, JDAL is  "is built on top of Hibernate ORM and Spring framework and provides you with a set of core database services and UI Components ready to be used via configuration on Spring context configuration files." Very interesting! Some of you will  no doubt know about the <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-rcp">Spring Rich project</a>, which hasn't been very active of late. It's great to see the community filling in the gaps! 
       </li>      
 
<LI>
Securing an application using Spring Security and Active Directory is feasible, but the specifics stumped me until just recently when I did some quick Googling and found <a href="http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?110284-Error-using-LDAP-Authentication-with-Microsoft-ADAM">this post from the SpringSource forums.</a> The solution's spelled out in explicit detail in the response. Convenient! 
 
</LI> 
   
  
    
    <li>Looking for a good matrix comparing Spring versus Java EE? One manager, a Bergisch Gladbach, <a href="http://niklasschlimm.blogspot.com/2011/06/spring-vs-java-ee-comparison-matrix.html">shares his</a>. Very interesting read, and one that reflects the norm for an increasingly large number of users today, I find. Check it out!  
      
    </li>
  
  <LI>
   <a href="http://loianegroner.com/2011/06/jaxb-custom-binding-java-util-date-spring-3-serialization/">A blog, by Loiane Groner, describes how to use custom dates with JAXB</a>. Admittedly, this blog is not very Spring specific, but it's something that you might face when using Spring's JAXB2 <code>Marshaller</code> with a client that doesn't support the same data serialization.  One example of this? Spring Android's Simple XML <code>Marshaller</code> doesn't support JAXB2 dates, by default! This is also a good blog to read for the links to the other, more Spring-specific and useful content.
    If only I'd known this sooner!  I can think of at least one code base that will benefit from this recipe... 
   </LI>
  
   <lI>
    <a href="http://javakata6425.appspot.com/#goToPageIIIarticleIIISpring%20MVC,%20GWT,%20Wicket,%20%20dynamic%20form%20comparison">Blog Java-Kata   takes a look at building a multi-row, dynamic form-based web application</a> using Spring MVC, Wicket, and GWT. This first installment introduces the code (which is useful in of itself) and then the Spring MVC iteration. Good stuff, with details for those who've wondered the same thing. Spring MVC is not a component-oriented web framework like Wicket and GWT, so it's nice to see it  still fares so well on this complex task.
