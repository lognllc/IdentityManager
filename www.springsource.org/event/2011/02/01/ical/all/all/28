SUMMARY:Webinar\: Introducing Spring Framework 3.1 - Europe
DESCRIPTION:<p>Spring Framework 3.1 continues Spring's mission with a focus on flexible Java-based configuration. This webinar introduces foundational 3.1 M1 facilities such as environment profiles for application contexts\, feature specifications within configuration classes\, and Spring’s new caching abstraction. Finally\, we’ll cover Spring’s ongoing support for enterprise Java specifications\: in particular our Servlet 3.0 support\, as scheduled for 3.1 M2.</p>
 <p>Europe\: <a href=\\"https\://vmwareevents.webex.com/vmwareevents/onstage/g.php?t=a&amp\;d=660554002\\">February 10\, 3\:00pm UK / 4\:00pm Europe</a></p>

SUMMARY:Partner Webinar\: Conversational Web Applications with Spring
DESCRIPTION:<p>Ever struggled with too few scopes in a web application? Do you feel that session scope is too long\, request scope too short\, and view scope (JSF 2.0) is not really addressing your needs?Spring 3.1 features a new window scope to keep browser windows and tabs apart from each other\, and a complete conversation management to scope your beans along the boundaries of a use case defined by business logic rather than a technical approach.</p>
 <p>This webinar provides a detailed introduction to window isolation and conversation management with a lot of examples and demos and how it will benefit the full stack of a conversational web application built with ICEfaces (JSF)\, including persistence tier and controlling mechanisms like webflow or workflow.</p>
 <p>Attendees will take away the information they need to add conversation management and extended scopes provided by Spring 3.1 to their own JSF / ICEfaces based web application. How to use conversations to scope JPA entity managers is the next topic and finally\, integration with other frameworks using the SPI of the conversation management for workflow or webflow is winding up the session.</p>

SUMMARY:Webinar\: Elastic Load-Balancing with VMware
DESCRIPTION:<p>How do you manage performance for apps with 100 to 500 users but no consistent peak periods? If you don't ensure sub-second response at all times\, your help desk will get flooded with complaints. But there's no budget for more servers to handle random load spikes. So what's the solution? Elastic load balancing with <a href=\\"http\://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/\\">VMware vSphere</a>™  and the <a href=\\"http\://www.vmware.com/products/vfabric/\\">VMware vFabric</a>™ Cloud Application Platform. Attend this informative webcast and learn how to\:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Cost-effectively run your app on two VMware vSphere virtual machines\: one for 250 concurrent users\, and the second for overflow.</li>
 <li>Balance your load across multiple virtual machines with the VMware vFabric ERS HTTP load balancer.</li>
 <li>Pinpoint slow response and automatically execute load-balancing action with VMware vFabric Hyperic® monitoring.</li>
 <li>Run a lightweight\, efficient Java app server—vFabric tc Server—in each virtual machine\, with automatic app provisioning.</li>
 </ul>
