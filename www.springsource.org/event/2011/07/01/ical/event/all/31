SUMMARY:Webinar\: Tuning Your Grails Applications - Europe
DESCRIPTION:<p><a href=\\"http\://www.grails.org\\">Grails</a> is focused on developer productivity more than raw speed\, but that doesn't mean it's a slouch. When you do need better response times\, there are plenty of options available - as this talk will demonstrate.</p>
 <p>Find out both how to isolate performance issues and what you can do to fix them. This is a large and complex area\, so the focus will be on Grails-specific solutions.</p>
 <p>Europe\: <a href=\\"https\://vmwareevents.webex.com/vmwareevents/onstage/g.php?t=a&amp\;d=661189972\\">July 13\, 3\:00pm UK / 4\:00pm Europe</a></p>

SUMMARY:Webinar\: Getting Started with Spring Data Redis - North America
DESCRIPTION:<p><a href=\\"http\://redis.io/\\">Redis</a> is an open source\, advanced key-value store known for its excellent performance\, its small footprint and embed-ability. The <a href=\\"/spring-data\\">Spring Data</a> project makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational \\"NOSQL\\" databases and cloud based data services.</p>
 <p>This webinar will introduce Redis\, its data structures\, the fundamental concepts behind it and the <a href=\\"http\://www.springsource.org/spring-data/redis\\">Redis support in Spring Data</a>\, and will showcase how easy it is to get started and scale out into a cloud environment such as <a href=\\"http\://cloudfoundry.com/\\">Cloud Foundry</a>.</p>
