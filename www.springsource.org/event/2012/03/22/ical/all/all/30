SUMMARY:Webinar\: SQL? NoSQL? NewSQL?!? What’s a Java developer to do? - Europe
DESCRIPTION:<p>NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra can simplify the persistence of complex data models and offer significantly better scalability and performance. But these databases have a very different and unfamiliar data model and APIs as well as a limited transaction model. Additionally the relational world is fighting back with so-called NewSQL databases such as VoltDB\, which use a radically different architecture for high scalability and performance as well as the familiar relational model and ACID transactions. In this presentation you will learn about popular MongoDB\, and Cassandra as well as VoltDB. We will compare and contrast each database’s data model and Java API using NoSQL and NewSQL versions of a use case from the book POJOs in Action. We will learn about the benefits and drawbacks of using NoSQL and NewSQL databases.</p>
 <p>Europe\: <a href=\\"https\://vmwareevents.webex.com/vmwareevents/onstage/g.php?t=a&amp\;d=660731529\\">March 22\, 3\:00pm UK / 4\:00pm Europe</a></p>

SUMMARY:Webinar\: Practical Tips for Spring Integration - Europe
DESCRIPTION:<p>This webinar will share some of the more interesting integration solutions that came out of the real customer engagements as well as the questions that are most frequently asked on <a href=\\"http\://forum.springsource.org/forumdisplay.php?42-Integration\\">Spring Integration forums</a>. It will showcase the Spring Integration framework and how it can help you to build\, manage and maintain powerful enterprise-grade integration solutions. Most importantly you will get an opportunity to ask questions which will be answered by the same engineers that develop the Spring Integration framework.</p>
 <p>In this initial installment of \\"Practical Tips\\" we'll begin covering some of the more advanced topics of enterprise integration such as 'message-flow-segmentation\\"\, \\"custom retry logic\\"\, \\"error handling\\"\, \\"timeouts' and more. Attendees for this webinar are expected to already be familiar with Spring Integration - watching the <a href=\\"http\://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAWpVS8t_Ug\\">Message Driven Architecture</a> is highly recommended for developers that want a basic conceptual introduction. </p>
 <p>Europe\: <a href=\\"https\://vmwareevents.webex.com/vmwareevents/onstage/g.php?t=a&amp\;d=661528551\\">April 19\, 3\:00pm UK / 4\:00pm Europe</a></p>
 <p>Future topics include\:</p>
 <p>More Practical Tips for Spring Integration on May 3rd (<a href=\\"http\://www.springsource.org/node/3525\\">Europe</a> - <a href=\\"http\://www.springsource.org/node/3526\\">North America</a>)<br />
 Management and Monitoring Spring Integration with JMX and Spring Insight TBD</p>
