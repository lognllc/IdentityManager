SUMMARY:Webinar\: Native Android Development with Spring Android - Europe
DESCRIPTION:<p>This session will provide an introductory overview of Android’s architecture\, the layout of an Android project\, the use of various Maven plugins and tools for enabling dependency management in your Android project. When building Android apps\, you can use a third party library\, like <a href=\\"http\://www.springsource.org/spring-android\\">Spring Android</a>\, that provides an abstraction for consuming RESTful services within your native Android app. Spring Android also supports the use of Spring Social on Android\, and we will discuss how Spring Social can help you connect your apps to OAuth protected services like Facebook and Twitter.</p>
 <p>Europe\: <a href=\\"https\://vmwareevents.webex.com/vmwareevents/onstage/g.php?t=a&amp\;d=668353572\\">March 08\, 3\:00pm UK / 4\:00pm Europe</a></p>
 <p>Hosted by <a href=\\"http\://blog.springsource.org/author/rclarkson/\\">Roy Clarkson</a>\, Spring Android Lead and Mobile Expert</p>

SUMMARY:Webinar\: SQL? NoSQL? NewSQL?!? What’s a Java developer to do? - Europe
DESCRIPTION:<p>NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra can simplify the persistence of complex data models and offer significantly better scalability and performance. But these databases have a very different and unfamiliar data model and APIs as well as a limited transaction model. Additionally the relational world is fighting back with so-called NewSQL databases such as VoltDB\, which use a radically different architecture for high scalability and performance as well as the familiar relational model and ACID transactions. In this presentation you will learn about popular MongoDB\, and Cassandra as well as VoltDB. We will compare and contrast each database’s data model and Java API using NoSQL and NewSQL versions of a use case from the book POJOs in Action. We will learn about the benefits and drawbacks of using NoSQL and NewSQL databases.</p>
