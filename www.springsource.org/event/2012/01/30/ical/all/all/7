SUMMARY:Webinar\: Spring Your Application to Cloud Foundry
DESCRIPTION:<p>Do you have a Spring app and want to deploy it to the cloud in a matter of minutes? </p>
 <p>In this webinar\, Ramnivas Laddad\, Senior Staff Engineer\, will show you how to take a typical Spring web application that uses a single data source and deploy it directly to Cloud Foundry without having to make any code modifications. He will show you how to use the command-line tool as well as IDE integration (SpringSource Tools Suite). No matter what your development style is\, you will find deploying apps to Cloud Foundry a simple process. We will also show a few goodies that help you interact with your deployed app.</p>
