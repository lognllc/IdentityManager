SUMMARY:Webinar\: Better productivity\: Grails 2 - Europe
DESCRIPTION:<p>With the imminent release of Grails 2\, it's time to find out just why we think you should upgrade. Or if you're not using it\, why you should give it a second look.</p>
 <p>This webinar will introduce you to the new usability features that are targeted at improving your productivity\, such as the new interactive command line\, improved class reloading\, and much better unit testing support. You'll also discover powerful new features such as 'where' queries\, database migrations\, and static resource (CSS\, JS\, etc.) handling.</p>
 <p>Europe\: <a href=\\"https\://vmwareevents.webex.com/vmwareevents/onstage/g.php?t=a&amp\;d=663861610\\">November 03\, 3\:00pm UK / 4\:00pm Europe</a></p>

SUMMARY:Webinar\: Introduction to Spring Data Neo4j - Europe
DESCRIPTION:<p>The <a href=\\"/spring-data\\">Spring Data</a> project makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational NOSQL databases\, cloud based data services\, for instance graph databases. This webinar is designed for enterprise developers that are working with Spring and need to understand how they would integrate a NOSQL graph database.</p>
 <p><a href=\\"/spring-data/neo4j\\">Spring Data Neo4j</a> is an integration library for the open source NOSQL graph database <a href=\\"http\://neo4j.org/\\">Neo4j</a> and has been around for over a year\, evolving from its infancy as brainchild of Rod Johnson and Emil Eifrem. It supports multiple\, annotation based POJO to Graph Mapping strategies\, a Neo4j Template API and extensive support for Spring Data Repositories. It can work with an embedded graph database or with the standalone Neo4j Server.</p>

SUMMARY:Webinar\: Introduction to using MongoDB and Spring Data on Cloud Foundry - Europe
DESCRIPTION:<p><a href=\\"http\://www.mongodb.org/\\">MongoDB</a> is a popular non-relational database that uses JSON documents as the data model. It was developed for cloud environments and as one of the original data services supported on Cloud Foundry it's a good choice for your cloud data service needs.</p>
 <p><a href=\\"http\://cloudfoundry.com/signup?utm_source=springsource_web&amp\;utm_medium=banner&amp\;utm_campaign=cloudfoundry-signup\\">Cloud Foundry</a> is an open source project sponsored by VMware. It's a multi-language\, multi-framework\, and multi-deployment cloud. It lets developers focus on what is really important -- their applications. Spring based applications are perfectly suited for Cloud Foundry which provides a set of tools to make developing and deploying these applications a simple task.</p>
 <p>The <a href=\\"/spring-data\\">Spring Data</a> project makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational NOSQL databases. One of the supported databases is the MongoDB document database.</p>
 <p>In this webinar\, we show what the combination of MongoDB and Cloud Foundry has to offer to Spring developers. We develop a sample applications\, show how to build and deploy it to the cloud. We also show how to connect to the MongoDB service bound to the application in the cloud. This provides the ability to import and export data and to run ad-hoc queries from a command line tool.</p>
 <p>After 60 minutes\, you will be ready to develop and deploy your own Spring applications using MongoDB to the cloud.</p>
