SUMMARY:Webinar\: Spring from Zero to Cloud in 60 minutes - Europe
DESCRIPTION:<p><em>Hosted by Ramnivas Laddad &amp\; Mark Fisher</em></p>
 <p><a href=\\"http\://www.cloudfoundry.com\\">Cloud Foundry</a>\, an open source project by VMware\, is a multi-language\, multi-framework\, and multi-deployment cloud. It lets developers focus on what is really important--their applications. Spring based applications are perfectly suited for Cloud Foundry which provides a set of tools to make developing and deploying these applications a simple task. </p>
 <p>In this webinar\, we show what Cloud Foundry has to offer to Spring developers. We will develop a few applications\, show how to use a variety of services with it\, and scale it to meet changes in demand. After 60 minutes\, you will be ready to develop and deploy your own Spring applications to cloud.</p>
 <p><a href=\\"https\://vmwareevents.webex.com/vmwareevents/onstage/g.php?t=a&amp\;d=667420157\\">Europe\: May 19\, 3\:00pm UK / 4\:00pm Europe</a></p>

SUMMARY:Webinar\: Lightweight Application Server Use Cases
DESCRIPTION:<p>The complexity\, cost and technological bloat of traditional Java EE application servers are often barriers to running a lean and efficient IT organization. Increased need for scalability and rapid application delivery are driving businesses to reconsider the platform they use for application deployment. By combining the portability and agility of the Spring framework with a lightweight application server\, your organization can meet business demands while staying within budget constraints. <a href=\\"http\://www.vmware.com/products/vfabric-tcserver/overview.html\\">VMware vFabric™ tc Server</a> is a modern\, lightweight Java application server based on Apache Tomcat. It improves developer productivity\, control and manageability—and is the most flexible platform for virtualizing Java applications and workloads for the cloud.</p>
 <p>Attend this webcast to find out about\:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Real-world examples of companies that have adopted VMware vFabric tc Server</li>
 <li>The decision process for moving to VMware vFabric tc Server</li>
 <li>Realized benefits of using Spring and VMware vFabric tc Server</li>
 <li>When it is appropriate to stay on a JEE platform</li>
 <li>Planning for future cloud deployments</li>
 </ul>
