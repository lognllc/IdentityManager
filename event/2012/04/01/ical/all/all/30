SUMMARY:Webinar\: Practical Tips for Spring Integration - Europe
DESCRIPTION:<p>This webinar will share some of the more interesting integration solutions that came out of the real customer engagements as well as the questions that are most frequently asked on <a href=\\"http\://forum.springsource.org/forumdisplay.php?42-Integration\\">Spring Integration forums</a>. It will showcase the Spring Integration framework and how it can help you to build\, manage and maintain powerful enterprise-grade integration solutions. Most importantly you will get an opportunity to ask questions which will be answered by the same engineers that develop the Spring Integration framework.</p>
 <p>In this initial installment of \\"Practical Tips\\" we'll begin covering some of the more advanced topics of enterprise integration such as 'message-flow-segmentation\\"\, \\"custom retry logic\\"\, \\"error handling\\"\, \\"timeouts' and more. Attendees for this webinar are expected to already be familiar with Spring Integration - watching the <a href=\\"http\://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAWpVS8t_Ug\\">Message Driven Architecture</a> is highly recommended for developers that want a basic conceptual introduction. </p>
