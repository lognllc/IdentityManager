SUMMARY:Webinar\: More Practical Tips for Spring Integration - Europe
DESCRIPTION:<p>This webinar will share some of the more interesting integration solutions that came out of the real customer engagements as well as the questions that are most frequently asked on <a href=\\"http\://forum.springsource.org/forumdisplay.php?42-Integration\\">Spring Integration forums</a>. It will showcase the Spring Integration framework and how it can help you to build\, manage and maintain powerful enterprise-grade integration solutions. Most importantly you will get an opportunity to ask questions which will be answered by the same engineers that develop the Spring Integration framework.</p>
 <p>In this continuation of the earlier \\"Practical Tips-and-Tricks\\" session\, we will cover some of the more advanced topics of enterprise integration such as advanced aggregation and resequencing\, asynchronous message flows\, message ID customizations\, content enrichment and advanced message routing and more.  Attendees for this webinar are expected to already be familiar with Spring Integration - watching the <a href=\\"http\://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAWpVS8t_Ug\\">Message Driven Architecture</a> is highly recommended for developers that want a basic conceptual introduction. </p>
 <p>Europe\: <a href=\\"https\://vmwareevents.webex.com/vmwareevents/onstage/g.php?t=a&amp\;d=665094285\\">May 03\, 3\:00pm UK / 4\:00pm Europe</a></p>
