SUMMARY:Webinar\: Creating Spring Insight Plugins - Europe
DESCRIPTION:<p><a href=\\"/insight\\">Spring Insight</a> is a developer tool that provides visibility into your application's runtime performance and behavior by tracing how low level SQL queries\, transaction times and application pages are performing. Optimized out of the box for standard Spring-developed applications\, Insight also provides a pluggable architecture for enhancing trace capabilities to provide further visibility into your application performance. In this session you will understand capabilities of Spring Insight's plugin framework and best practices in development of plug-ins.</p>

SUMMARY:Webinar\: Native Android Development with Spring Android - Europe
DESCRIPTION:<p>This session will provide an introductory overview of Android’s architecture\, the layout of an Android project\, the use of various Maven plugins and tools for enabling dependency management in your Android project. When building Android apps\, you can use a third party library\, like <a href=\\"http\://www.springsource.org/spring-android\\">Spring Android</a>\, that provides an abstraction for consuming RESTful services within your native Android app. Spring Android also supports the use of Spring Social on Android\, and we will discuss how Spring Social can help you connect your apps to OAuth protected services like Facebook and Twitter.</p>
